&#60;p&#62;It's worth mentioning that Scripto itself is CMS-neutral (See &#60;a href='http://scripto.org/documentation/about/'&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;). Developers can build their own tools to make it talk with whatever CMS they want. So far, they've built the connectors for Omeka, WP, and Drupal, but more would be awesome.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not sure about Scripto to record TEI, though, since the transcriptions are recorded in MediaWiki.

&#60;p&#62;These are excellent questions, Ethan.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding image importing, at the moment the only transcription tools I know of supporting any sort of integration with external images are Scripto (Omeka, Wordpress, Drupal), FromThePage (Internet Archive), Islandora TEI Editor (Fedora), the (closed-source) BYU Historic Journals project (ContentDM), and Zooniverse Scribe (via deep-linking to any image on the internet, at a per-page level).  This is, in my opinion, a serious and non-trivial problem with all transcription tools -- just last week I talked with a librarian who really wanted to use T-PEN for medieval manuscript fragments, but was going to use Scripto instead, purely because the images were on their Omeka site.  It seems like rather than using the right tool for the job--and my own FromThePage would be just as inappropriate as Scripto for this use--she was using the tool which integrated with her CMS.  The problem is that it's a lot of effort to integrate tool X with CMS Y, and it's not a problem that scales well across either dimension.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not aware of any transcription tools that do linked data at all.  I know that I've looked into it for FromThePage, but those investigations remain just that -- exciting ideas which do not override improvements to the core tool.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding exports, the XML-(or TEI)-native T-PEN and Bentham Transcription Desk should support export of whatever TEI you use to put into them.  Ditto for MOM-CA-based tools like Itinera Nova, Monasterium, Virtuelles deutsches Urkundennetzwerk as well as the Papyrological Editor.  Mind you &#34;should&#34; is my own term -- I don't know if any of these tools actually feature an 'export' button or API.  FromThePage converts transcripts, subjects, indices, and edit histories into one big HTML file for export, with classes which may allow extraction and conversion.  (I explored TEI export in 2009, but at the time had no background in TEI and abandoned the project -- things will be different soon, however.)  I gather that Scripto exports to the CMS which is its database-of-record, and suspect that CrowdCrafting may well have an export feature as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I love your idea of combining annotation and open data -- it seems to come up all the time in conversation these days, but I don't know of any projects which have gotten beyond the idea stage.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sorry, to dredge up an old topic, but are any of the tools listed here capable of importing images from or otherwise interacting with DSpace? FromThePage appears to support some of the annotations that I would like to make about manuscript images, but I want to avoid making duplicates of images, if possible (since various derivatives will already be available in DSpace, should I elect to use it).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, is anyone aware of annotation tools that interact with web services, such as linking manuscripts to resources defined in VIAF or Geonames?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What sorts of export mechanisms are provided by these annotation tools?  Can I export to TEI?  MODS?  Something else?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I envision using an annotation tool in the back-end to generate TEI or some other robust form of metadata with links to thesauri like VIAF, Geonames, or the Pleiades Gazetteer of Ancient Places in order to import a lot of open data for enhanced context, generate maps, etc.

&#60;p&#62;If you are a student and need SNA software for your coursework, you can get NetMiner 4 coursework license for free for 6 months. It features statstics and visualization as well as SNA. And it's very easy to use. I think it is valuable to try. :-)&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm starting some contract work on a small, new website for a grant-funded curricular program. Between now and when the site launches, I need to communicate with a small group of non-technical faculty stakeholders/collaborators about all the usual components of a new site: wireframe prototypes, sample graphic designs, current status of work, bugs/enhancement requests, and such. For reasons related to travel and scheduling, it'll be difficult to get everyone in the same physical space before the site launches, and I need some good tools to streamline that communication.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For these faculty, the default communication method would usually be email, but that quickly becomes unwieldy for &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&#34;&#62;agile development approaches&#60;/a&#62;. For some of what I need, I could cobble something together from Google tools, but I'm not ready to teach humanities faculty how to file bugs/enhancements into a &#60;a href=&#34;http://trac.edgewall.org/&#34;&#62;Trac&#60;/a&#62; system.  I'm looking for something a little cleaner and smoother. I don't have a private server, so I'll need either a hosted service or something that can run happily on a shared webhost. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My software-developer friends in industry tell me that &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/overview&#34;&#62;Atlassian Confluence&#60;/a&#62; is a really good option for what I need. At $10/month for the hosted version with 10 users, it's cheap, but I'm reluctant to deploy something that'll be an ongoing budget expense unless it really is better than other options (i.e. less work for me). What other tools should I be considering?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm using &#60;a href=&#34;http://bitbucket.org&#34;&#62;BitBucket&#60;/a&#62; to host my own private Git repositories for writing in Markdown and LaTeX--- including my dissertation text. But I think the key problem with GitHub or similar for non-code projects is that the conventions of discussion and commenting used in programming communities (bug databases, mailing lists) aren't common among humanists (yet?). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(For example: If you're GitHubbing a Markdown document and someone has a problem with a wording, do they drop their quibble in an HTML comment next to the sentence? Do they fork the repository, make the change, then file a pull request?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I was recently discussing finding aids with a bunch of archivists, and the topic was how to enable archives users to contribute their knowledge back into an electronic finding aid. For me as a programmer, &#34;use a version control system!&#34; was an obvious answer, but it didn't fly in the real world. They would have required specific training in how and why to use version control; they currently use Word to edit their finding aids; and supporting them as they learned to use version control (of any sort) would have required additional tech staff they didn't have the money for. So, they're back to edit-locks on network drives and walking over to one another's desks to resolve the edit locks.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In short: GitHub (or other version control) for non-code projects is a great idea for people who are comfortable climbing technical learning curves. Those who are already self-identified DHers may fall into that category. On the other hand, any project worth doing hopefully relies on subject-area knowledge from participants who've spent their energy learning non-technical skills and may not want to learn version control. I'd be leery of deploying GitHub by fiat in such an environment without having a team member who can support those participants' needs.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;One development worth watching may be the rise of non-code GitHub repositories among the development community.  The New Haven Ruby user group has started using the GitHub wiki interface for &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/newhavenrb/conferences/wiki&#34;&#62;conference notes&#60;/a&#62; and invited other conference-goers to contribute, whether from outside the New Haven group or from other conferences.  I'm not entirely clear why this seems to work better than any other wiki, however -- perhaps because Ruby conference attendees are already on GitHub and have GitHub accounts?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I would agree with Lincoln -- there's a potential risk in contributors turning away from contributing if they had to use Github. But, I really like the idea of using Github for things that aren't code projects. I've been using Github in ways that aren't necessarily tied to strictly code. For example, &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hepplerj/cv&#34;&#62;my CV resides there&#60;/a&#62;, and I also archive &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hepplerj/jekyll-blog/tree/master/_posts&#34;&#62;all my blog posts&#60;/a&#62; with Github. I've also just moved the full text of &#60;a href=&#34;http://hepplerj.github.com/rubyist-historian/&#34;&#62;The Rubyist Historian&#60;/a&#62; to Github (in part to offer a way for others to add to or modify the document if they choose to, but also to make distribution/reading easier and build in redundant backups).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Another advantage you might have, in addition to Github's easiness as a website, are the GUI interfaces that are available. I totally understand that CLI interaction can seem intimidating especially for those who don't spend any time there. But, using something like Github for Mac makes it easy to fork, add files, modify files, etc. and perhaps helps overcome some reluctance to use Github. If the kinds of contributors you envision for this are generally DHers, you might be able to assume some basic level of familiarity with git or svn that overcomes any misgivings among contributors.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Using GitHub for a project that wants widespread participation seems like a risk to me. For example, I'm using GitHub for one project and the collaborators are reluctant to learn GitHub. (It might also have something to do with code.) But you do have the relative easiness of the GitHub website working for you. With links to GitHub's documentation, I would hope this could work.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You might be able to offer an alternative way for people to participate if they don't want to learn GitHub. For example, you might offer to add people's documents to the repository if they e-mail them to you.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been seeing increasing interest and activity around using GitHub for non-code projects, for example Lincoln Mullen's Profhacker post on &#60;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/how-to-fork-a-syllabus-on-github/39447&#34;&#62;How to fork a syllabus on GitHub&#60;/a&#62;. So I want to take a reading on how ready DHers in general are to use GitHub in that way, and even more, to fork a project, make changes both by &#60;em&#62;adding&#60;/em&#62; files (similar to Zotero group functionality) and &#60;em&#62;editing&#60;/em&#62; existing files (similar to wiki functionality), and issue a pull request to bring the changes back into the original repository.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As an example, I'm considering putting together a big set of materials useful for doing Omeka training sessions. I'd invite people both to add their handouts or files, and edit the list of possible lessons and activities, which are in a markdown file (again, Lincoln Mullen has a Profhacker post: &#60;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/markdown-the-syntax-you-probably-already-know/35295&#34;&#62;Markdown: The syntax you probably already know&#60;/a&#62;. It will also include code samples and activities, which is what first made me think of GitHub. In theory, intro to Omeka materials could be built up this way. But practically, would I lose too many potential contributors?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We've thought about how to do this in our &#60;a href=&#34;http://dsl.richmond.edu/emancipation&#34;&#62;Visualizing Emancipation&#60;/a&#62; project at the University of Richmond.  We used semi-opaque circles around a centroid to denote varying levels of uncertainty. It is a pickle for user interface design, especially if you have overlapping data that you want displayed simultaneously.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Korey,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It sounds like in part you're interested in the field we call &#34;Content Strategy&#34;.  Here are some well-regarded books on the topic:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Content-Strategy-Work-Real-world-Interactive/dp/0123919223&#34;&#62;Content Strategy at Work&#60;/a&#62; by Margot Bloomstein&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Content-Strategy-Web-2nd-Edition/dp/0321808304&#34;&#62;Content Strategy for the Web&#60;/a&#62; by Kristina Halvorson&#60;/li&#62;

&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cmsmyth.com/&#34;&#62;The CMS Myth&#60;/a&#62; blog might be another good starting point for you.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for, but George Williams wrote a ProfHacker article last year about &#60;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/how-to-run-a-group-authored-blog/30080&#34;&#62;how we manage the writing of that blog&#60;/a&#62;. It doesn't cover everything you're looking for, but it hits a lot of it.

&#60;p&#62;I suspect the classicists have solved this best. The &#60;a href=&#34;http://pleiades.stoa.org/&#34;&#62;Pleiades project&#60;/a&#62; has a pretty nice set of conventions for dealing with uncertain geographical metadata--if I remember right (the site's not loading for me now) it involves a bounding box to give the outer limits of a point, and a separate field to show the level of uncertainty.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It tends to be ugly to put polygons on a map, though--I think the Barrington atlas (the print publication Pleiades draws from) just uses a dotted line or italics or something under the names of uncertain location.
