			<description>&#60;p&#62;Although the question is a few years old, the answers still hold, but the best way is to learn by doing it. Pick a text, pick an editor, and try to mark it up. There are lots of gotchas in XML, but a decent editor will shield you from the worst of them. Unfortunately there are very few free XML editors (Emacs is one, but not recommended for beginners). If trial and error, or a book, is too much, there's always something like the Intro sessions at the XML Summer School and similar events -- &#60;a href=&#34;http://xml.silmaril.ie/moreinfo.html#events&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://xml.silmaril.ie/moreinfo.html#events&#60;/a&#62; (I edit this, so let me know any errors).

&#60;p&#62;Right, so the rightsholder keeps the copyright but grants the the institution a license to make it available online.  The Deep Blue agreements fit this situation.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Kevin,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for your answer. Apologies for the delay in responding to it.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am thinking of a situation where an author or their estate might allow a text (or version of a text) to be made available online - in images of the manuscript, an ocr'd text file or evn in formatted TEI while still retaining copyright in other cases.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;All the institutional repositories I can think of only require a license for the repository to reproduce, not transfer of copyright.  (If transfer were required, it would prevent IRs from including preprints or postprints of journal articles published under green open access.)  See, for example, &#60;a href=&#34;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/static/about/deepblueip.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/static/about/deepblueip.html&#60;/a&#62; .

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi folks,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Can anyone point me to archive / library / repository deposit agreements which allow for online reuse and / or publishing of in copyright material?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have seen some agreements which transfer copyright to the repository institution. I am interested in these but also in possible agreements which retain copyright in most cases.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you can send a link to freely available online examples that would be great. If you would prefer not to make your agreement public that's also fine, all correspondence will be confidential.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Padraic&#60;/p&#62;

&#60;p&#62;Thanks, Kevin! perma.cc looks perfect for this. When I went to the webpage and saw it a &#34;request beta access&#34; sign-up form, I wasn't optimistic that it'd be ready in time for me to submit the paper. To my surprise and delight, though, I got a beta account notification yesterday, so now I'm set.

&#60;p&#62;Neat, I didn't realize you could do that. I think it runs into the same basic problem, though, as my scenario #2: all in all, there's probably 100 relevant pages (including child and grandchild pages), and I'd rather avoid saving them all individually if possible.

&#60;p&#62;You could ask the Internet Archive to archive the pages in question (&#60;a href=&#34;http://faq.web.archive.org/can-i-get-just-one-page-archived/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://faq.web.archive.org/can-i-get-just-one-page-archived/&#60;/a&#62;) and then use the links in the archive.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You could link to an Internet Archive version of the page, should that exist. That would have the added benefit of dating your access (up to a point; it won't be perfectly precise).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working on an article where most of my bibliography entries involve links to university wiki pages, or documents hosted by that same wiki service. I don't have a ton of confidence that the service will necessarily exist in five years, or at least, that it will exist in a way that won't break all the links. I'm personally committed to ensuring that the content remains available; in the past, when I've just needed a reliable link to an isolated wiki page, I've re-posted wiki content on my own website and used that link. It'd be harder to do that here, though, because in many cases I'm referencing entire sections of the wiki, consisting of multiple pages. When/if the day comes for me to &#34;rescue&#34; the whole thing, I'd probably take a different approach than re-posting content. I'd also expect that when/if the wiki service shuts down or changes, it probably won't be possible to set up (even temporarily) a redirect to wherever I'm hosting the content instead.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any suggestions for what I should do about these links in the paper? The three options that've come to mind, in increasing order of appeal, are:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) Just use the current links, and get over it.&#60;br /&#62;
2) Include a link to a page on my own site somewhere in the paper, where I'll maintain a current list of reference URLs.&#60;br /&#62;
3) Look into creating an &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/ezid/&#34;&#62;EZID&#60;/a&#62; for each of the links, and use that to update the URL (I'm not 100% sure if I'll be able to get access to the EZID service).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Has anyone come up with an elegant solution for this?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I realize it is too late, but I would also recommend the section of Plato's Phaedrus where Socrates tells the story of the invention of writing. It is around 274-275. It is short and others refer back to it like Postman.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone,&#60;br /&#62;
Just wanted to follow up and say thank you for the help. Seriously.&#60;br /&#62;
Here is the &#60;a href=&#34;http://courses.rachaelsullivan.com/248/schedule.html&#34;&#62;the final list&#60;/a&#62; I decided on. After much hand-wringing, to be sure.&#60;br /&#62;
@&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/jean_bauer'&#62;jean_bauer&#60;/a&#62;: the &#34;Praise of Scribes&#34; was amazing but I couldn't fit it in without making the load uncomfortably cramped. I hope to integrate some of it into day 1 discussion on Tuesday. Thank you!&#60;br /&#62;
@Dorothea Salo: Let there be memex. :-)&#60;br /&#62;
@Josh Honn: Thanks for the Aleph pointer. Am going to work that into the class plan when they read the story the night before.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;gratefully,&#60;br /&#62;
Rachael

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Kathleen Fitzpatrick's &#60;em&#62;Planned Obsolescence&#60;/em&#62; (&#60;a href=&#34;http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/mcpress/plannedobsolescence/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/mcpress/plannedobsolescence/&#60;/a&#62;) addresses these issues related to scholarly communication in the academy. I don't see this turn of phrase in the online text, but when speaking on this topic she often says &#34;we need filters, not gatekeepers.&#34; Her section on peer review might be most relevant to you.
