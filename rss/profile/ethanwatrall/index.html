			<description>&#60;p&#62;Readers may also be interested in Neatline, a newly-released tool for creating timelines and geo-temporal visualizations from the content of Omeka collections: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://neatline.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://neatline.org/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The timeline feature in Neatline may be used alongside its map-annotation features, or separately (as &#34;Neatline Time&#34;). Users of the larger Neatline plug-in have to ability to indicate ambiguity or uncertainty in events plotted on the timeline, making it a more attractive option for humanities interpretation than most existing timeline systems.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sorry for going around exhuming old questions but there is a new tool that I think is way better than all the others (and I am not just saying that because I work for it).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It's called myHistro and it focuses on the geographical visualization of the events which is something that all other tools lack.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I wrote a short article about its use in the classroom here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.myhistro.com/blog/interactive-timelines-for-teachers-and-students&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.myhistro.com/blog/interactive-timelines-for-teachers-and-students&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Want to add an update to Patrick's update from six months ago, the procedures for exporting item data from an Omeka.net site for import into a self-hosted Omeka site can be found here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://info.omeka.net/manage-an-account/expiration-and-renewal/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://info.omeka.net/manage-an-account/expiration-and-renewal/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also want to emphasize that this export provides you with a CSV file that contains item metadata and links to your files for importing into another Omeka site. Exhibits and pages have to be replicated by hand, there is no export of any plugin-related data.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Just an update -- we're pretty sure that we have things in place to do an export from Omeka.net to an Omeka.org site. However, because of the cost factors of downloading an entire site, it's something that should only be a one-time thing, when you have things set up and are sure you want to make the switch.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Welcome back Melissa, though I'm only giving you a C+ for your efforts in staying away :).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'll resist the deplorable example of Ethan and not &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.ca/Visual-Interface-Digital-Cultural-Heritage/dp/1409404226&#34;&#62;toot my own horn&#60;/a&#62;, but I will say that &#60;a href=&#34;http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo6027946.html&#34;&#62;Switching Codes&#60;/a&#62; was one of my favourite recent reads. And of course anyone in text analysis will have already pre-ordered Ramsay's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/75tms2pw9780252036415.html&#34;&#62;Reading Machines&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm totally going to pimp my own book here - because it is relevant.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;Archaeology 2.0: New Models for Communication and Collaboration.&#34;  Published by UCLA Cotsen Institute of Archaeology Press.  Digital version is open access (available through eScholarship) and released under a CC BY SA license.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Folks,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm back to work after a year-long career break next month. Although I've kept up to date with online blogs, twitter, etc, I havent read any books related to DH in the past year, and wondered if you had any recommendations. What books have you read that really grabbed you and would be worth exploring?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm interested in anything related to DH, Internet Technologies, Cultural Heritage, and online communities. What is worth investigating? What's the best thing you've read in the past year? I'd appreciate any of your heads-up. Thanks.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Melissa
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Brett Bobley's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/assessing-coauthored-contributions-in-dh#post-1147&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While I would generally agree with this, its important to note that w/in anthropology, there are different opinions as to the &#34;weight&#34; of collaborative work.  These opinions almost always break down along sub-disciplinary lines.  There is less of a recognition of collaborative work among socio-cultural anthropology.  This has a lot to do with the fact that socio-cultural has more of a &#34;lone scholar&#34; tradition.  On the other hand, archaeologists are generally more tolerant and accepting of collaborative work.  This has to do with the fact that the nature and process of archeological research is deeply collaborative and interdisciplinary.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The process Sheila's describing would involve getting directly to your database to upload that tables, usually through a tool like phpMyAdmin, which is pretty standard on most hosting services. It would also call for making sure that the archive files, etc. get moved to the correct location on your server. Usually that happens with a tool like FireFTP or another FTP tool.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We can help with sorting those details out, too.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Katy, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To clarify, the zip files can't be uploaded to your Omeka site like you would upload a jpg to attach to an item.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We will give you the ability to transfer your .Net website to a server of your choice by providing a zip with a MySQL dump of the site's database, and a copy of the Omeka installation, including the archive (files, theme uploads, image derivatives), themes, and plugins.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
