			<description>&#60;p&#62;There's also the MLA's &#60;a href='https://www.mla.org/About-Us/Governance/Committees/Committee-Listings/Professional-Issues/Committee-on-Information-Technology/Guidelines-for-Evaluating-Work-in-Digital-Humanities-and-Digital-Media'&#62;Guide for evaluating DH work&#60;/a&#62;. It's (sadly) less about grad students than tenure and promotion, but seems to still apply. If nothing else, the fact that MLA (and AHA, for that matter) have produced guides for DH evaluation says clearly that the professional organization says that DH does, in fact, correlate with language, literature, and teaching.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;(We tweeted a bit, but for anyone else happening on this question...)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;DH dissertations in general&#60;br /&#62;
-----&#60;br /&#62;
1. The CUNY Graduate Center fellows and staff do amazing work making more kinds of dissertation possible, and in particular I'd suggest looking for blog posts and video from their #remixthediss event/project (e.g. &#60;a href=&#34;http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/pieces/what-dissertation-new-models-methods-media)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/pieces/what-dissertation-new-models-methods-media)&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2. They maintain a collaborative GoogleDoc where people doing current or past non-monograph dissertations (humanities and not, digital and not) describe and link to their projects: &#60;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/remixthediss-models&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://bit.ly/remixthediss-models&#60;/a&#62;. I don't think these are included there, but two additional completed DH+textual literature dissertations to check out or use as examples are:&#60;br /&#62;
* Lisa Rhody's literature dissertation using topic modeling and visualization to explore ekphrastic poetry: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lisarhody.com/project/revising-ekphrasis/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.lisarhody.com/project/revising-ekphrasis/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
* Tanya Clement's literature dissertation included the creation of an experimental scholarly digital edition: &#60;a href=&#34;http://digital.lib.umd.edu/transition/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digital.lib.umd.edu/transition/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;3. Here's a Zotero library of articles and guidelines for doing DH dissertations and applying for DH promotion/tenure (the latter often being applicable to arguing for the former): &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/amandavisconti/items/collectionKey/V9DA47T7&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.zotero.org/amandavisconti/items/collectionKey/V9DA47T7&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My DH+textual studies dissertation&#60;br /&#62;
-----&#60;br /&#62;
I defended a DH dissertation about public digital humanities and digital textual scholarship for the University of Maryland's literature Ph.D. To show the department chair what a completed DH+textual studies dissertation can look like, or reuse some of the DH and literature precedents I used in my arguments:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The dissertation did not include any chapters; I used design, code, usertesting, blogging, and an analytical report written during last month before defense.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The completed dissertation is this website: &#60;a href=&#34;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The dissertation produced a participatory digital edition of Ulysses (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.infiniteulysses.com)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.infiniteulysses.com)&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My doctoral exams areas were DH and textual scholarship (list and introductory essay explaining choices here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/assets/ExamsSharingCopy.pdf)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/assets/ExamsSharingCopy.pdf)&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I blogged about twice a month through exams and the dissertation, both about my research and the larger meta aspects of doing a digital/DH dissertation: &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&#60;/a&#62;. In particular, this post has some practical advice on getting started (&#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation&#60;/a&#62;) and this post has info on choosing your dissertation's format (&#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/04/02/digitaldissformat)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/04/02/digitaldissformat)&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The slides and text of my successful dissertation defense talk are here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/20/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/20/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am happy to email with this student (or anyone curious about DH/digital dissertations!) via &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:amandavisconti@gmail.com&#34;&#62;amandavisconti@gmail.com&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone: I have a former grad student who wrote to me in a panic. Apparently, her current department chair has decided that her previous coursework in DH, book history will not count towards her current graduate program, because it does not &#34;correlate&#34; to literature, composition, or teaching. (Wow. I can barely even.) The chair is apparently reacting to an accreditation review and has asked for justification in language accessible to non-specialist peers. Does anyone have go-to resources for helping us make this case? Thank you --

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much. That post's question seems very similar to mine indeed! I'm just now looking into the replies you've directed me to via CODE4LIB in LISTSERV.  (I had to register first.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One reply mentions Zotero, which some of the above posts suggest. The other replies seem related to library cataloguing purposes and are pretty technical in nature. But I am keeping an open mind.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far I've been doing some practice conversion of my printed entries into Zotero in Firefox. I will be reading up on Drupal, exploring Drupal's Biblio Zotero plug in, etc., as suggested above.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Still open to further suggestions, however.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've just applied for funding this project. Outcome will not be until December. So I expect to be researching possibilities further and, as I say, still welcome further suggestions. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[Update: the link to my website in my first post is no longer active; the archived link is &#60;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20131209052925/http://susanhollismerritt.org/index.html&#34;&#62;susanhollismerritt.org&#60;/a&#62;.]

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Further update:&#60;br /&#62;
I have posted some more recent information pertaining to the proposed project to which this thread relates in the Day of DH 2016 (April 8) site.  Please see my Day of DH 2016 blog &#60;a href=&#34;http://dayofdh2016.linhd.es/merritt/&#34;&#62; The Harold Pinter Bibliography (Searchable Digital Database) project&#60;/a&#62;, especially my first post &#60;a href=&#34;http://dayofdh2016.linhd.es/merritt/2016/03/18/hello-world/&#34;&#62; Hello world!&#60;/a&#62;, created on March 18, 2016.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you have additional suggestions to add to the earlier ones, please post them here, at DH Q&#38;amp;A.  I will greatly appreciate them. Thank you.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thank you so much, Patrick. The advice is appreciated. I've managed to download several years of the text, but the OCR is pretty terrible. Also, I've read a bit about topic modeling, but I'll look into it a bit more.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Goals and scope for the project might depend on the difficulty of the part of the project that's implicit in all your questions -- getting OCR'd text or some other electronic form out of the articles. A quick look at their site makes it look expensive, and some publishers get squeemish, at least, about this kind of project.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Depending on how you can get reasonably in machine-readable form, you might have to limit the scope to only one issue a year, or to a smaller date range, or both. That might make the 4th question a bit more feasible than the others.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On the other hand, if you can get everything, the 1st question sounds like a good topic modeling project.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Getting cited texts sounds pretty hard, or at least labor intensive. It would be difficult to parse out citations from the plain text. However, if you can't get plain text and only have images to work from, then that sounds like the most feasible question to pursue after you do that labor intensive work of collecting the data.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm interested in learning more about computer-based textual analysis, so I developed a project using the journal Literature/Film Quarterly (LFQ). I haven't done this sort of research before, so I'm trying to determine the best questions to ask and the tools that will help me answer them. I'm hoping someone might be able to tell me if these are reasonable questions to ask. I'd also appreciate any suggestions. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;LFQ began in 1973 and continues now. As the oldest journal in the field, looking at the text should be able to provide some insights about how adaptation studies developed.  At about 50 articles a year for 43 years, I'm looking at 2150 articles.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Questions: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Can an examination of the entire text of LFQ reveal anything substantial about the way adaptation studies has changed from 1973-present?&#60;br /&#62;
What are the most frequently cited texts in each year? WebofScience doesn't support this journal.&#60;br /&#62;
What names (other scholars) appear most frequently each year?&#60;br /&#62;
What kinds of terms are used in earlier years (e.g. “fidelity,” &#34;intertextuality&#34;) and do they continue throughout the journal’s history?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If there are other questions that I could explore, I'd appreciate any suggestions.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Patrick Murray-John's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/map-or-directory-of-digital-humanists#post-2382&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;All of this began because I heard through live tweeting about an NEH-funded effort in San Diego to create a local consortium regarding digital pedagogy and DH. It's been in play for almost a year at a CSU (my university's system). I was incredibly overjoyed to see this happened at a CSU where DH Centers are rare due to funding and space limitations. Even in the CSUs there's no way to contact faculty at the other 22 campuses to see who's playing with DH. And, admittedly, I've expended lots and lots and lots of time trying to organize locally over the years. But, it's a time suck and my department doesn't give me professional credit for doing this kind of work. Glenn Worthey created a meet-up group for DH in the Bay Area, but it's fragmented (and again takes lots of time). Stanford has its LitLab and CESTA. There's a few faculty at other local institutions (and there are many in the Bay Area!) but I have no idea who unless I cold call departments. And then that doesn't necessarily inspire anything other than a &#34;hey, how's it going?&#34; We need a better way to make contact. If for anything, so we can collaborate locally and host events and avoid reinventing the wheel on projects. (I was just part of a California gathering of DHers; if I'd known about the San Diego lot, I would have strongly recommended them to be invited to the gathering as well!) &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, if there's data already out there from Day of DH, can we go through it to create even an ugly listing of DHer locales?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Yeah, that is a challenge that lots of different places have been trying to tackle in different ways, especially at a more local level. Examples of that are the &#60;a href='http://nycdh.org/'&#62;NYCDH site&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href='https://phillydh.org/'&#62;DH Philly&#60;/a&#62;, and &#60;a href='http://vadhconsortium.org/'&#62;Virgina DH Consortium&#60;/a&#62;. Those are basically attempts in other places to tackle the same problem, with varying degrees of success. Difficulty for all is finding the people who should join up in the first place, which is more at the heart of your question.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, I'm more confident about the regional efforts to build a DH community than I am with an effort at a national or international listing by location. I suspect that there will be more word-of-mouth growth at that local scale to build up membership in such sites (both NYCDH and VA are using Commons In A Box, I think, so setup is pretty easy).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you're in the Santa Cruz neighborhood, I think some folks at UCSC have at least started talking about how to build up a group for that area.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I haven't been especially active on it, so I don't know how helpful it might be, but there's also the &#60;a href='https://digitalhumanities.slack.com'&#62;DH Slack&#60;/a&#62;, where you might be able to ask and spot people in your neighborhood.

&#60;p&#62;Good solutions and ones that I've used over the last decade, but California is a very, very big state. And waiting for planned events or infrastructure to be instituted isn't quite what I'm looking for. I've been at this DH thing for a few years, and I'm  interested in expanding my network of DHers beyond the seredipity meet n'greet or the pub phenomenon (discovering each other by accident). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It would be terrific if we had a directory of some sort so we don't miss each other (and don't have to wait for yearly events such as Day of DH). Even DHCommons doesn't have a geographical sort to its list of collaborators. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Anyone want to take this up or propose it to Day of DH organizers?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Day of DH is a good bet for finding others. Also, keep an eye out for local THATCamps. They are a great way to make those face-to-face meetings.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Has anyone ever created a directory or map of Digital Humanists? I ask because there are so many doing DH in California but I don't know where or how to find them. I follow lists on Twitter, keep updated on recent scholarship and writings, talk to many people, but still I hear about California DH events after the fact. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Would really like to know if someone has taken this up based on the directory from DHNow or DHCommons or Day of DH. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I bet if we knew there was someone down the street that we could get up to some interesting shenanigans in DH
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
