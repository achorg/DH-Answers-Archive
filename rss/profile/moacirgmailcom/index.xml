			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been using GoodReader for a few months and it seems to work well for this sort of thing.  I can bring in PDFs from Dropbox, FTP, box.net, Google Docs, etc. It also has a built-in web browser so I can get to JSTOR, or other repository, and download PDFs of articles fairly directly.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for annotations, I use the highlighting most in GoodReader-- not sure how well it exports to other viewers though.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I haven't used GoodReader, but I do use iAnnotate (based on some recommendations from my Twitter feed), and I find it quite good. It's a breeze to pull in PDFs from Dropbox or from websites. The highlighting and annotations work well, and best of all, they're readable with other PDF viewers.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It's Christmas at my household, which means that I can finally ask this question. I have been using GoodReader on my phone, and I generally like the wide array of means by which one can get to files, the reading experience in general, and the annotation seems a bit clunky, but good enough.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My friend refuses to believe that there is a program for reading scholarly journals, chapters of books, things one has scanned, etc. that is better than iAnnotate.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;How do you all feel? Has anyone tried both? I can't really say money is the issue (since I decided that I apparently *need* FIFA11 on my iPad right after springing for GoodReader), but I would like to avoid getting heavily into the groove on one program or the other on the device and then switching up after succumbing to pressure from my DH peers.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Or you could do what I've seen many kids doing with their ereaders, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.drinkmalk.com..&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.drinkmalk.com..&#60;/a&#62;. clearly these are not authoritative texts, but if what you seek is popular enough (you said &#34;novels&#34;), it might be in here.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Some copyright holders would certainly argue that you can't make a full copy of a work, even for a transformative purpose not involving making that copy fully available.  (See Authors Guild et al. v. Google Inc., pending in the New York Southern District Court.)  If sued, you might win a challenge for copyright infringement by arguing that your use is very different from selling copies to readers and therefore not infringement.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Getting a machine-readable version of your files through a brute-force method like scanning, OCR, and/or keyboarding allows you to work with practically any source document you can get your hands on, but it's awfully expensive.  As you say, it's a lot cheaper to get source files from a publisher -- or to get access to a corpus someone else has built.  People who have built corpora of contemporary materials would know how to negotiate with rightsholders.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you're willing to limit yourself to content under copyright whose rightsholder has made it available by agreement to the world through HathiTrust, you might consider using the HathiTrust Data API described at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.hathitrust.org/data&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.hathitrust.org/data&#60;/a&#62; to get at the OCR text, thereby saving you all digitization costs.

&#60;p&#62;Publishers are probably not going to turn over digital source files, even with agreements on how that material would (and wouldn't) be used--but more to the point, it could take you a very long time to find this out for sure.

&#60;p&#62;Brilliant. Thanks. I'll check that out, though for my modest needs, a TEI'd text might be overkill.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;But it still seems like publishing houses are not a way out of the situation.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;In that case, since you're at the University of Chicago, I'd recommend that you contact The U of C Library's Digital Library Development Center--they are a member of the TEI Consortium, and as such, have access to the membership benefit provided by Apex, namely conversion of print to machine-readable text marked up in XML, for a price starting at about 50 cents a page.  More information here: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/AccessTEI/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/AccessTEI/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As long as you're not proposing to republish the result, the fact that the original text is in copyright is not (in my non-lawyer view) a problem.  You would still be able to publish results of your analysis.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Very much so under copyright. The point is not to republish, but rather to use as a sandbox for analysis. I have in mind something like just a novel.

&#60;p&#62;Are the texts in question under copyright?  And if so, is the purpose to republish them, in whole or in part?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi. Half of my question was already answered in &#34;&#60;a href='/topic/when-your-texts-arent-digital-yet#post-106'&#62;When your texts aren't digital (yet),&#60;/a&#62;&#34; but I was wondering if anyone here has any record of success getting digital versions of books without scanning. -- Has anyone, say, written to a publisher and asked for their inhouse pdfs?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I somehow doubt a publishing house (unless it's something like, maybe, Library of America?) would distribute these digital files, but if someone has had success in the past, I'd like to know precisely what stream of words in a letter made the publisher cave.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks,
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
