			<description>&#60;p&#62;You may also want to consider using Polinode. At the moment, Polinode lets you not only visualize and analyze network data like Gephi, but also to collect network data via highly-flexible relationship surveys. You are also able to import network data for analysis from an Excel file or in JSON or GEXF format. If you are interested, you can check out a short video at our website (full disclosure: I am the founder):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.polinode.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.polinode.com&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You might want to use Social Networks Visualizer from &#60;a href=&#34;http://socnetv.sourceforge.net&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://socnetv.sourceforge.net&#60;/a&#62; It is a open-source, cross-platform graphical application for analysis and visualization of social networks. It allows you to load or create and modify social networks in a canvas, rotate, zoom, change node attributes, analyse their social and mathematical properties and apply visualization layouts for relevant presentation in papers etc. Can create known social datasets automatically as well as random networks and small worlds. Computes basic graph properties, such as density, diameter, geodesics, connectedness, eccentricity, etc. It also calculates advanced measures for social network analysis such as centrality and prestige indices (i.e. closeness centrality, betweeness centrality, information centrality, proximity and rank prestige), triad census, cliques, clustering coefficient, etc.

&#60;p&#62;If you are a student and need SNA software for your coursework, you can get NetMiner 4 coursework license for free for 6 months. It features statstics and visualization as well as SNA. And it's very easy to use. I think it is valuable to try. :-)&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking forward to your experiences in Haiti. Although, I've shared some of this information with you in private, I thought I would post some of these resources for the larger DH community (never too early to start preparing them for &#60;a href=&#34;http://caribbean2012.thatcamp.org/&#34;&#62;THATCampCaribe&#60;/a&#62;!):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Caribbean Association of Libraries, ACURIL is an invaluable resource for connections in the area: &#60;a href=&#34;http://acuril.uprrp.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://acuril.uprrp.edu/&#60;/a&#62; They are doing an excellent job, and they acknowledge the role of new technologies in the future of Caribbean archival and scholarly communications work.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To get an overview of the present state of libraries across the Caribbean region, a good book to read is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Caribbean-Libraries-Century-Changes-Challenges/dp/1573873012&#34;&#62;Caribbean Libraries in the 21st Century&#60;/a&#62;. The book covers mostly the English-speaking Caribbean, but most of the issues are relevant to the other linguistic areas.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For Haiti in particular, an invaluable source of information and networking is the Haitian Studies Association: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.haitianstudies.umb.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.haitianstudies.umb.edu/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As Jen Serventi pointed out, Brown U. is a key player here. They happen to have the largest collection of Haiti materials outside of Haiti. The contact there is &#60;a href=&#34;http://library.brown.edu/sr/profile.php?id=30&#34;&#62;Dominique Coulombe&#60;/a&#62;. I had the pleasure of meeting with her recently, and she is eager to work with that collection. Let me know if you're interested. The Department of Africana Studies there is also looking to make things happen.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Immediately following the earthquake, the John Carter Brown Library put together a digital project called Remember Haiti.  Here's the website &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/remember_haiti/index.php&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/remember_haiti/index.php&#60;/a&#62;.  In the About this Site section, I see that they list all of their partners.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Brian ... are you following Laurent Dubois on Twitter? He's&#38;lt;@Soccerpolitics)&#38;gt;. He might be a good resource for you. We were in the same cohort at the University of Michigan in anthropology graduate study. He's now a professor at Duke and a good Caribbean scholar who has done some interesting work in Haiti. Hope all is well in Kansas.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I will be travelling to Haiti next week to attend the INURED conference &#38;lt;http://inured.org/conference.html&#38;gt; and then several days of site visits to libraries and universities. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would be very interested in hearing from the DH community any thoughts or experiences with digital projects focusing on Haiti in particular, or developing countries in general. What kinds of collaborative projects (with local institutions) are most useful or practical? What works well, and what doesn't. What are the most feasible ways to bring DH projects and access (or basic library training and development) to countries with low technical infrastructure and connectivity, and high levels of poverty? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know of several initiatives focused on providing open access to scholarly or cultural resources in Haiti, including&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Digital Library of the Caribbean: &#60;a href=&#34;http://dloc.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dloc.com/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
Libraries Without Borders--Haiti: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.librarieswithoutborders.org/?cat=32&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.librarieswithoutborders.org/?cat=32&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
eGranary Digital Library: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.widernet.org/egranary/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.widernet.org/egranary/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;and a previous DH Answers post on Haiti: &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-dh-tools-for-best-access-in-haiti#post-283&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-dh-tools-for-best-access-in-haiti#post-283&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What roles are there for digital humanities in Haiti and developing countries, and how to we help it happen?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Okay, well the following will likely fall in the latter category...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Lisa Nakamura's name first comes to mind as she's written a whole bunch of stuff on race and the internet, i.e. her book Digitizing Race: Visual Cultures of the Internet.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Angela Haas wrote a dissertation on the intersection between technology &#38;amp; American Indians: &#34;A rhetoric of alliance: What American Indians can tell us about digital and visual rhetoric,&#34; and she has an article in Computers &#38;amp; Composition Online called &#34;Making Online Spaces More Native to American Indians: A Digital Diversity Recommendation&#34; available here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/Haas/index.htm&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/Haas/index.htm&#60;/a&#62;. I am also a big fan of her article &#34;Wampum as Hypertext: An American Indian Intellectual Tradition of Multimedia Theory and Practice.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Melanie Yergeau is doing really interesting stuff drawing from disability studies on autism and multimodality. I'm not sure what she's published on since I gather this from a conference presentation I saw earlier this year. I wrote a bit about it on the CHI blog, though my description probably really oversimplifies her presentation (see the last couple paragraphs): &#60;a href=&#34;http://chi.matrix.msu.edu/2011/05/06/digital-rhetorics-at-cccc-2011/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://chi.matrix.msu.edu/2011/05/06/digital-rhetorics-at-cccc-2011/&#60;/a&#62; She also has a webtext, &#34;aut(hored)ism&#34; published through Computers &#38;amp; Composition Online here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/dmac/index.html#&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/dmac/index.html#&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Iswari Pandey's &#34;Literate Lives Across the Digital Divide,&#34; published in Computers &#38;amp; Composition, traces the writer's movement between Nepal and the U.S. over time and talks about the relationship between technology and politics across these spaces. He argues that while we often think of access as contingent on things like wealth and status, governmental politics also play a huge role.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Doug Walls has a *fantastic* webtext published in Kairos called &#34;An 'A' word production: A case for mindful rhetorical media use&#34;  &#60;a href=&#34;http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.1/disputatio/walls/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.1/disputatio/walls/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Robyn Tasaka wrote a dissertation that explores racial and ethnic representation on college Hawai'i club websites, titled, &#34;Challenges and privileges, entanglement and appropriation: Rhetorical practices of Asian Americans from Hawai'i&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Other stuff I've come across but not gotten around to reading myself:&#60;br /&#62;
Cameron Bailey's &#34;Virtual Skin: Articulating Race in Cyberspace&#34;&#60;br /&#62;
Kristine Blair &#38;amp; Pamela Takayoshi's collection Feminist Cyberscapes: Mapping Gendered Academic Spaces&#60;br /&#62;
Byron Burkhalter's &#34;Reading Race Online: Discovering Racial Identity in Usenet Discussions&#34;&#60;br /&#62;
Radhika Gajjala's Cyberselves: Feminist Ethnographies of South Asian Women&#60;br /&#62;
Emily Ignacio's Building Diaspora: Filipino Cultural Community Formation on the Internet&#60;br /&#62;
Lena Karlsson's “Consuming Lives, Creating Community: Female Chinese-American Diary Writing on the Web”&#60;br /&#62;
Lori Kendall's &#34;Class, Race, and Online Participation&#34;&#60;br /&#62;
Stephen Knadler's “E-Racing Difference in E-Space: Black Female Subjectivity and the Web-Based Portfolio”&#60;br /&#62;
Beth Kolko, Lisa Nakamura, and Gilbert Rodman's collection, Race in Cyberspace&#60;br /&#62;
Linda Leung's “Where Am I and Who Are ‘We’?: Self-representation and the Intersection of Gender and Ethnicity on the Web”&#60;br /&#62;
Heidi McKee's “‘YOUR VIEWS SHOWED TRUE IGNORANCE!!!’: (Mis)Communication in an Online Interrracial Discussion Forum”&#60;br /&#62;
Steven McLaine's “Ethnic Online Communities: Between Profit and Purpose”&#60;br /&#62;
Ananda Mitra's “Virtual Commonality: Looking for India on the Internet”&#60;br /&#62;
Alondra Nelson &#38;amp; Thuy Linh Tu's collection Technicolor: Race, Technology, and Everyday Life&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Just for clarification--are you looking for works that talk about diversity, inclusion, and access within DH as a field of study (i.e., works that discuss the backgrounds of folks who identify as DHists and the work that they do)? Or are you also looking for works that deal with issues relevant to DH (though they may not be explicitly situated in DH) that talk about things like technology &#38;amp; race/disability/access/inclusion a bit more generally? Or both?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Coming out of the THATCamp CHNM 2011 diversity, inclusion, and accessibility session, I hope to survey existing resources and literature on these issues in DH. Any help? A search for the keyword &#34;diversity&#34; here on DH Q&#38;amp;A doesn't provide many results - &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/search.php?q=diversity&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/search.php?q=diversity&#60;/a&#62; ...

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi James,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There's been a lot of work done on digital prosopography  at King's College London by John Bradley and others.  My new colleague, Tim Hill gave a talk on it last year: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2010.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2010.html&#60;/a&#62; (June 18).&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've begun reading Short Manual to the Art of Prosopography by Koenraad Verboven et al and taken a look at the Berkeley Prosopography Services Wiki. Any other suggested resources would be greatly appreciated.
