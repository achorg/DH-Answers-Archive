				<title>Michael Ullyot on "What are essential introductory theorizations of the Model?"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-are-essential-introductory-theorizations-of-the-model#post-2036</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd like to ask both a research and a teaching question, about the most productive *and* accessible theorizations of the Model in artistic, scientific, and in-between disciplines like ours.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm teaching a course (this fall) in my university's interdisciplinary arts-and-science undergraduate program on the very broad theme of 'representation.' I'm comparing the relationships between scientific theories, artistic representations, and quantitative/tractable models of research objects (in any field) that make them computationally addressable. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The question is this: which essays or articles would best introduce these advanced undergraduates to the third category? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Willard McCarty's essay, &#34;Modeling: a study in words and meanings&#34; from *A companion to digital humanities* (2004), is cited in Matt Burton's &#34;Joy of Topic Modeling&#34; blog post last month &#38;lt; &#60;a href=&#34;http://mcburton.net/blog/joy-of-tm/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mcburton.net/blog/joy-of-tm/&#60;/a&#62; &#38;gt;. This seems the natural place to start, but I wonder if readers have used other texts to induce intelligent non-specialists to join, or at least to grasp, our field.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;These are my other texts:&#60;br /&#62;
* David Bohm, *On Creativity*&#60;br /&#62;
* Virginia Woolf, *The Waves* (and Stephen Ramsay's work on the same)&#60;br /&#62;
* Richard Dawkins, *The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing*&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With thanks,&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I follow Digital Campus from CHNM, of course, and the Scholar's Lab from UVA (both on iTunesU). But which other podcast series do DHists recommend for keeping abreast of developments in the field? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Yes, it's a deliberately open question which 'field' I'm talking about. My own is literary criticism, but I'd be interested in anything applicable to the humanities and social sciences. &#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Here is my provisional list of the ways visualization could be used in the digital humanities. Could DHers suggest more to add to this list, and/or better categories?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;~ For language-based research: text mapping, word trees and clouds, and phrase nets (all for text analysis); scatterplots (for historical usage); databases (of texts and metadata).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;~ For spatial/temporal research: timelines and historical maps (both with animations, embedded documents, and other related information); &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;~ For performance/fine arts research: simulations and animations of performances.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Maureen Stone's essay &#34;Information Visualization: Challenge for the Humanities&#34; in this CLIR / NEH report (2009) is worth reading:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub145abst.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub145abst.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I like that it addresses questions of information literacy more broadly.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Michael,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We've been working on planning a center here at Emory, too. It's a big job, with lots of questions, but these are the &#34;big-idea&#34; resources I found most helpful. Unfortunately, they're pretty U.S.-centric, but perhaps you can find some ideas that are useful to you. By far the most productive thing we've done, though, is talk to people at some of the centers we respect. I really recommend doing that if you can. &#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;My faculty is requesting applications for financial support, and my department is proposing a new centre for digital humanities scholarship. We would start modestly, with a research-seminar series and a couple of computers, and aspire to a Scholars-Lab and CHNM-sized future. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any resources the community could suggest to help with the proposal stage? We have to answer a series of inter-related questions like the purpose and impact of the centre; whom it will serve; why it's current; what our initial budget would be (the really difficult question!); and what external sources of funding we would hope to attract.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm cooking up a project here at Carleton to use the web.alive platform from Avaya &#60;a href=&#34;http://http://avayalive.com/WaStore/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://http://avayalive.com/WaStore/&#60;/a&#62; (which uses the Unreal engine) to recreate the layers &#38;amp; contexts from a small scale training excavation, as a tool for demonstrating how archaeological knowledge is created. The idea being that be engaging with actual manipulable objects, deeper learning is created.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm also working with agent based modeling &#38;amp; simulation, using the netlogo environment &#60;a href=&#34;http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/4.1.1/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/4.1.1/&#60;/a&#62; .

You could use Netlogo to prototype a simulation, and then scale up with the supercomputer... On the GIS and Agent Based Modeling blog, they also describe some experiments in marrying the two together (3d immersive worlds where you interact with artificially intelligent agents) &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.gisagents.blogspot.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.gisagents.blogspot.com/&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There are a variety of things you can do with 3D visualization.  I have worked on several cultural heritage reconstruction projects, most recently two Roman houses, the House of the Faun in Pompeii and the House of the Drinking Contest from the port city of Antioch.  Both models recontextualize the artwork in the houses by placing high-resolution images of mosaics into the appropriate spaces and calibrating the model to the latitude and longitude of the site in order to accurately simulate the sunlight at a particular minute in history.  This is especially useful for observing the way light interacts with artwork, architecture, and people, especially during social situations like formal dinners (example: &#60;a href=&#34;http://people.virginia.edu/~ewg4x/hotdc/caa-hdc-medium.mov)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://people.virginia.edu/~ewg4x/hotdc/caa-hdc-medium.mov)&#60;/a&#62;.  The lighting simulation methodology can be applied to more than just these two projects, but to any site reconstruction.  Candlelight can also be simulated.  Applying accurate lighting to a reconstruction enables one to pose scholarly questions that otherwise never would have been considered.  The next step is to bring the House of the Drinking Contest into a 3D game engine, Unity.  Unity is becoming the standard engine for cultural heritage reconstructions.  It is powerful and free for non-commercial purposes.  Once the model is in Unity, the museums that now own the mosaics that were once in the house will be able to use the model for demonstration purposes to patrons.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've also worked a bit with landscapes.  Last year, I created a model of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and the Austrian Archaeological Institute (who excavates Ephesus) graciously provided me with GIS terrain data for the square kilometer in which the temple resides.  This terrain included a large mountain to the southwest.  I converted this terrain data into a 3D model that I imported into my project, and with lighting simulation, was able to recreate the landscape more realistically, observing when the temple fell into the shadow of the mountain.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for artifacts, there are a wide variety of 3D scanning projects out there.  Depending on the type of artifact, you may not need to create 3D models to observe the three-dimensionality of the object.  Polynomial texture mapping may be of use for objects that are somewhat flat, like coins or illuminated manuscripts (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/ptm/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/ptm/&#60;/a&#62;)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Steve -- I would definitely check out the Virtual Vault project.  It is a collaboration between the Arizona State Museum and the Center for Desert Archaeology to create this amazing virtual version of their huge collection of southwestern pottery.  They are using low-cost technology to create 3-D images of their collection.  It enables both museum visitors and researchers to virtually &#34;handle&#34; the pottery that, in real life, is too fragile for you to touch.  We helped fund it via a Start Up Grant.  I saw Doug Gann from UArizona demonstrate it at the museum and it was really terrific.  Doug is also experimenting with putting the virtual images in CAVEs and the like so you can compare them to each other over time.  Here's an article with links:&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've also replied to your Twitter query, but I'll pass along the same information.  The NEH Office of Digital Humanities has put together a Humanities High Performance Supercomputing Resource Page that you might find useful.  The page may be found at &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/fVPSI&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/fVPSI&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There were three recipients of the special NEH/Department of Energy Humanities High Performance Computing program.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;o   The Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University for its project Large-Scale Learning and the Automatic Analysis of Historical Texts.  The Perseus project will be using advanced computational linguistic technologies to experiment with the analysis of ancient texts for the study of classics and other fields. Additional information may be found at &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/fVSeM&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/fVSeM&#60;/a&#62; .&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;o   The University of California, San Diego for its project Visualizing Patterns in Databases of Cultural Images and Video.  UC San Diego will be creating computerized visualizations of large databases of digitized cultural heritage materials and performing statistical analyses on the data to discover new ways of studying art and culture. Additional information may be found at &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/fVS8Q&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/fVS8Q&#60;/a&#62; .&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;o  The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia for its project High Performance Computing for Processing and Analysis of Digitized 3-D Models of Cultural Heritage.   IATH will process previously-acquired raw datasets of culturally valuable objects such as artistic statuary, archaeological artifacts, and historical architecture in order to create highly accurate 3-D models for the study of art and architecture. Additional information at &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/fVQhC&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/fVQhC&#60;/a&#62; .  David Koller, the PI, has also received a Digital Humanities Start Up Grant to continue work on his project.  More information on this project at &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/fVS1m&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/fVS1m&#60;/a&#62; .

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Steve, knowing your work and role at Brown, I suspect you're thinking specifically in the cultural heritage / museums realm -- but correct me if I'm wrong.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Richard Levy presented a great (and image-rich) paper at the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.playingwithhistory.com/&#34;&#62;Playing with Technology in History&#60;/a&#62; symposium, “3-D Interactive Worlds as Educational Tools for Understanding Arctic Life.”  I'm reproducing the abstract below, and the paper's available in draft form &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.playingwithhistory.com/abstracts/&#34;&#62;on the site&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I liked it, personally, because it was about affective and subjective response -- not about the kinds of big-data or analytical verisimilitude projects we so often hear about with regard to supercomputing and viz.  (Since I imagine you'll get a bunch of responses about those possibilities -- &#60;a href=&#34;http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/~dk/&#34;&#62;work like David Koller's&#60;/a&#62; -- I thought I'd toss this one in at the outset!)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;Richard Levy: This paper explores how interactive 3-D worlds and computer modeling can be used to excite interest in traditional dwellings constructed by indigenous groups in the Canadian High Arctic. This paper explores the degree to which digital replicas of objects, houses and simulations can be used to support the study of Arctic history in interactive worlds. Also examined is the idea that virtual worlds can to evoke emotive, effectual knowledge in indigenous users. The discussion will be based on our experience with primary school and college students, and Padleirmiut Inuit Elders who experienced digital reconstructions of Inuit dwellings in a 3D virtual theater (CAVE) at the University of Calgary. Results suggest that virtual heritage environments may be useful in initiating and establishing discourses in archaeological interpretation, as well as assisting personal identity recovery.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have the opportunity to develop a proposal to work with Brown's visualization group - supercomputers, a CAVE for 3-D presentation, great computer imaging possibilities. I've come up with schemes involving presentation of artifacts and landscapes... but I'm sure there are other possibilities, either that someone's tried, or someone has considered trying. What's the state of the field, the most interesting work so far? What needs more research?
