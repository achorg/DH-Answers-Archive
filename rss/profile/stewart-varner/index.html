			<description>&#60;p&#62;The question was asked on my behalf.  Thank you everyone for some very useful suggestions.  I'll digest them over the weekend.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've struggled a bit with this, too, since the field is so broad. Sometimes I'd think I'd done a great job explaining, only to have librarians tell me later that my explanation was confusing. I've learned to try to tailor my explanation to the group I'm talking to, and to spend a lot of time on a few projects rather than slaloming through a bunch. So if I'm in a presentation setting, I'll try to get a sense of what the audience might find interesting. Some of my go-to example projects are those that are easily grasped, visually impressive, and clearly accomplish something that couldn't easily be accomplished as a monograph: &#60;a href=&#34;https://republicofletters.stanford.edu/&#34;&#62;Mapping the Republic of Letters, &#60;/a&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.americanpast.org/voting/&#34;&#62;Voting America&#60;/a&#62;, and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/index.faces&#34;&#62;Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database&#60;/a&#62;, for example. You don't need a technical background to see what these projects do and why they're cool. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My favorite online directories include the &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/The_CUNY_Digital_Humanities_Resource_Guide&#34;&#62;CUNY Digital Humanities Guide&#60;/a&#62;, Lisa Spiro's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/getting-started-in-the-digital-humanities/&#34;&#62;&#34;Getting Started in the Digital Humanities,&#34;&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://arts-humanities.net/&#34;&#62;arts-humanities.net&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are many examples of library-based DH, too: &#60;a href=&#34;http://scholar.library.miami.edu/archivoteatral/&#34;&#62;The Cuban Theater Digital Archive&#60;/a&#62;, the &#60;a href=&#34;http://livingstone.library.ucla.edu/&#34;&#62;Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project&#60;/a&#62;, and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://docsouth.unc.edu/blueridgeparkway/&#34;&#62;Digital Blue Ridge Parkway&#60;/a&#62;, to name a few. Projects like these might provide some inspiration if your library is looking for ways to support DH.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In addition to what Brian said, I always point people to Lisa Spiro's amazing round-up blog post on Getting Started in the Digital Humanities.  You can find it here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/getting-started-in-the-digital-humanities/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/getting-started-in-the-digital-humanities/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, the folks here at Emory's Digital Scholarship Commons would be more than happy to chat/skype/hangout with anyone who wants to talk about supporting DH as librarians.  you can email me directly at &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:stewart.varner@emory.edu&#34;&#62;stewart.varner@emory.edu&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;As a first thought, I would suggest looking at the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arl.org/resources/pubs/spec/complete.shtml&#34;&#62;ARL Spec Kit #326&#60;/a&#62;, which examines Digital Humanities in the Library. I'd also consider a number of &#60;em&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports&#34;&#62;CLIR Reports&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/em&#62;, including #143, A Survey of DH Centers in the US.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What resources would you recommend for introducing librarians to what DH is and what it can do? Examples of DH/library projects would be great, as well as sites that explain field and link out to more resources? (other than ACH, of course!) thanks

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks Wayne!  The prof mentioned a couple of GUIs he had tried but he did not mention this one.  I'll pass this on and report back here if I learn anything new.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Back when I was doing this type of analysis on a more regular basis, I found the Excel's statistical packages relatively robust without having to move to something like SPSS or SAS. However, since the goal is to work with the data in some more obscure output formats (or at least more computationally intensive outputs), you're a bit limited to packages that have a programmatic interface that allow the math analysis and programmatic, granular control of the output format.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, there are a lot of GUIs for R already which may get you further down this path (or at least allow you mask some of the complexity); one I thought was particularly well done (or at least reminded me more of MATLAB) was RStudio (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.org/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.rstudio.org/)&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;As promised, I gathered some more information.  here is what the professor is looking for:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;The size of the data set varies with the project.  One student this year was working with thousands of observations from the Gallup poll, but another had only county-level data for West Virginia.  I want to focus on visualizations that are poorly supported in other packages, in particular box plots (also known as box-whisker plots) and various variations such as notched plots, variable width plots, violin plots, and beam and fulcrum plots.  Important for all of these is the order of the plots, and possible sub-groups of plots.  Also underdeveloped are good ways of visualizing correlation matrices -- using color, shape, or size to mark the magnitude and direction of the correlation.  And finally scatterplots.&#34;
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I suspect it might help if you could give us a bit more of a sense of the types of data to be visualized and the types of visualizations that are of interest. For static visualizations, I'd probably want to confirm that common charting tools in something like Excel or even more specialized charts in something like SPSS are really and truly insufficient. Those are obviously limited, but they tend to be easier to use and maybe more appropriate at some stages. Beyond that, it may be more specific tools for specific purposes, such as specialized &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-are-some-useful-tools-for-creating-timelines&#34;&#62;timeline tools&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everybody,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am looking for a very powerful data visualization tool for historians.  A professor has been teaching his students R in his Quantitative Methods class but (understandably) feels that the learning curve is too steep.  He was asking me about creating a user interface for R but, before we think about how to go down that path, I thought I should check with the community.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, any thoughts?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
