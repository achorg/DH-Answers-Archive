&#60;p&#62;Yep, I see the same funny divide (in particular at ALA, where Micah and I also talked about this a bit!). But one place that there was good overlap was at the LITA sessions, so getting involved there would be a good place to get the bridges happening. IMLS also funds a lot of DH work, so keeping an eye on projects and events they are connected with will also help to get the right people together in the right rooms, virtual or physical.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Peter - this topic comes up frequently at THATCamps, and is one that I've been asking now for a while also. My two cents? LIS grads (librarians) need to step up to the plate and become &#34;digital humanists&#34; by doing things that DHers do; write prolifically, build things, have good ideas and implement them, apply for and win grants, and most importantly find ways to connect scholarship to technology. I agree with Arno that there are some great things being done in some libraries, but on the whole, we haven't yet made a clear case that we want to be involved, have the skills (scholars chops as well as technical) to contribute to a project, and that the library is supportive of this sort of work. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I proposed this as a session at THATCamp Southeast a few weeks ago too. My session proposal is here - &#60;a href=&#34;http://southeast2012.thatcamp.org/03/08/alt-lis/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://southeast2012.thatcamp.org/03/08/alt-lis/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Lets work together to become the &#34;collection of people to see the void and attempt to bridge the gap&#34;!! &#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Arno Bosse's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-can-lis-graduates-have-greater-involvement-in-digital-humanities#post-1542&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the response, and for the article link too. My personal feeling overall is, that it will take someone, or a collection of people to see the void and attempt to bridge the gap in a meaningful way.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know I'm not alone in the LIS world in being interested in entering DH anyway, but it's still a relatively small number who are, and in my experience mostly new graduates.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Ben Showers posted a nice article about this recently which takes a fair shot at providing some obvious areas of overlap and convergence: &#60;a href=&#34;http://infteam.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2012/02/23/does-the-library-have-a-role-to-play-in-the-digital-humanities/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://infteam.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2012/02/23/does-the-library-have-a-role-to-play-in-the-digital-humanities/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My personal sense is that while there are several libraries housing innovative, interesting programs engaging (and actively helping to define) the digital humanities (e.g. the Scholar's Lab at UVA; the NYPL) there are also academic &#38;amp; research libraries that are either flailing (e.g. don't really know how to engage with their departments, students &#38;amp; faculty on DH projects) or are just, well, simply wrong about the strategic approach they are taking. The national, institutional and personel contexts (i.e. convictions of the senior staff) are so varied that it's very hard to draw a general picture. I'd hate to have to generalize. And on top of all that both areas are experiencing rapid change due to various internal and external pressures. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Perhaps the best way to answer the question is in fact exactly as you proposed - to seek out &#38;amp; highlight for yourself a wide variety of DH projects which you feel are interesting, innovative and meaningful and which you'd like to be involved as well some day, and then look carefully at who was involved and why. Then use this as a guide to chart the course of your own studies and work experience.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, this is my first question, so apologies if I miss the point a bit (I'm not sure which category suits best). Anyway I'm currently studying for a an MLIS, having nearly done an MA in Digital Humanities. My intention is to do a PhD in Digital Humanities (well so long as my application is successful). My background is in fact history, but I am hoping my LIS skills will become as important, and can help tie my humanities background to this field in someway.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I may be wrong, but from what I see there is a slight disconnect between the two fields, one that I hope to help bridge, but I'm not entirely sure how. I've been told librarians have been involved in digital humanities, but no-one has really explained how beyond some traditional work. Can anyone point me to, or highlight how LIS/Librarians have been involved in this field?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Again, sorry for the long winded post.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Peter , Ireland

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Canadian (well, American-in-Canada) perspective here. DH-in-libraries is still a relatively nascent item, so I for one am focusing regional -- going to THATcamps, doing local evangelism. Our own library based DH centre is still in development, so perhaps when it spins up and things even out a bit there might be a call to think a little more broadly.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A little birdie told me that ALA Midwinter in Dallas will have a panel called &#34;Online and Above the Radar: Ensuring the Use and Discoverability of Digital Collections&#34;, which hopefully will have some Omeka representation, so that's something?

&#60;p&#62;RBMS is calling for some pre-conference papers on DH (and I'm submitting with the director of our special collections):  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;RBMS 2012 Preconference Call for Short Papers&#60;br /&#62;
SUBMISSION DEADLINE: December 15, 2011&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;FUTURES!&#60;br /&#62;
53rd Annual RBMS Preconference&#60;br /&#62;
San Diego, California&#60;br /&#62;
June 19 - 22, 2012&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Planning for the 2012 RBMS Preconference is entering the final stages.&#60;br /&#62;
This year's theme is FUTURES! The 2012 RBMS Preconference will explore&#60;br /&#62;
a multiplicity of futures for the rare book, manuscript, and special&#60;br /&#62;
collections community. How are special collections materials being&#60;br /&#62;
discovered and used today? How will they be discovered and used&#60;br /&#62;
tomorrow? Who will our users be, and what will they need? What forms&#60;br /&#62;
will special collections materials take? Join us to learn, discuss,&#60;br /&#62;
share, and contemplate. Now is the time to shape and prepare, because&#60;br /&#62;
the future is now.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Preconference will feature engaging plenaries, educational&#60;br /&#62;
seminars, lively discussion groups, and dynamic short paper&#60;br /&#62;
presentations. Plenary sessions will address three facets of our&#60;br /&#62;
theme:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Use: Digital Humanities&#60;br /&#62;
Discovery: Linked Open Data&#60;br /&#62;
Object: Book&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Clearly there are many, many more aspects of this theme to explore, so&#60;br /&#62;
we invite short paper submissions that address our theme in creative&#60;br /&#62;
and thought-provoking ways. Short papers can be broadly theoretical or&#60;br /&#62;
solidly practical; they can be the result of intense personal research&#60;br /&#62;
or the fruit of a productive collaboration.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A subcommittee of the 2012 RBMS Preconference Program Planning&#60;br /&#62;
Committee will review all submissions and select and organize the&#60;br /&#62;
papers into intellectually coherent clusters of three or four 15 to 20&#60;br /&#62;
minute presentations. There will be one time slot during which four&#60;br /&#62;
short paper sessions will run concurrently.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Proposals of 500 words or less should be sent to Mike Kelly&#60;br /&#62;
(mkelly@amherst.edu) no later than December 15, 2011. Final selections&#60;br /&#62;
by the Short Papers Subcommittee will be announced early in the New&#60;br /&#62;
Year.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Short Papers Subcommittee:&#60;br /&#62;
Mike Kelly, Amherst College&#60;br /&#62;
Melissa Nykanen, Pepperdine University&#60;br /&#62;
Katie L.B. Henningsen, University of Kentucky&#60;br /&#62;
Karla Nielsen, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A Note on Preconference Program Planning: The process of Preconference&#60;br /&#62;
Programming is not always clear to newcomers to the section, and even&#60;br /&#62;
some who have been around for a while. The Preconference Program&#60;br /&#62;
Planning Committee is responsible for the overall theme and schedule&#60;br /&#62;
of the conference, including selecting plenary speakers and organizing&#60;br /&#62;
discussion sessions. Their work began at the 2011 Midwinter meeting in&#60;br /&#62;
San Diego. The Seminars Committee is responsible for development of&#60;br /&#62;
seminars that may, or may not, be directly tied to the Preconference&#60;br /&#62;
theme. The 2012 Preconference will feature ten seminars, some of which&#60;br /&#62;
have been in development for over a year. Short papers are a way to&#60;br /&#62;
open the Preconference to participation from a wider range of voices&#60;br /&#62;
than may be represented in the other sessions on a shorter timeline.&#60;br /&#62;
Those interested in helping to shape the 2013 Preconference, should&#60;br /&#62;
attend the first meeting of the 2013 Preconference Program Planning&#60;br /&#62;
Committee during ALA Midwinter in Dallas.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There was a great deal of emphasis on the digital humanities at DLF's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.diglib.org/forums/2011forum/&#34;&#62;most recent forum&#60;/a&#62;, and the Digital Library Federation has also launched a partnership with &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet&#34;&#62;centerNet&#60;/a&#62;, an international alliance of digital humanities labs and centers, around a set of shared interests:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.diglib.org/community/collaborations/centernet/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.diglib.org/community/collaborations/centernet/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;DLF also sponsored conference registration discounts for a number of first-time librarian attendees at the annual &#60;a href=&#34;//dh2011.stanford.edu&#34;&#62;DH conference&#60;/a&#62; last summer at Stanford, which I thought was terrific.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In general, many librarians are members of the &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org&#34;&#62;ADHO&#60;/a&#62; organizations, including the &#60;a href=&#34;http://ach.org&#34;&#62;ACH&#60;/a&#62; (your friendly hosts of DH Answers!).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Yes, ACRL is the place to look: An ACRL Digital Humanities Interest Group was just launched this fall, and we'll be having our first meeting at ALA Annual 2012.  Also, we are organizing a Digital Humanities and Librarians pre-conference that will be held at ALA Annual 2012, and more details about that will be coming out this spring. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Other library-related organizations that are good places to look at are DLF (www.diglib.org), Council of Library and Information Resources (CLIR, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.clir.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.clir.org&#60;/a&#62;), and the Assocation of Research Libraries, which just published a report on digital humanities centers in libraries at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arl.org/news/pr/spec326-6dec11.shtml&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.arl.org/news/pr/spec326-6dec11.shtml&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Well... here's a further question - where are current DHbrarians investing their professional development at the association level? I'm struggling to reconcile this with the grand idea of the Big Tent (librarianship and DH), and how I want to support it, but my interests in the field are starting out so specialized. I want to invest my time in exciting, new, developing areas. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Will look in to your recommendations, thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;ALA is the wrong level to look at, as you suspected. Watch ACRL. Also keep an eye on the Coalition for Networked Information and the Association for Research Libraries. Another possibility is the academic section of the Special Libraries Association.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There is a lot of talk about the major disciplinary conferences like MLA and AHA having substantial increases in sessions devoted to digital humanities. I am worried/wondering why library associations like ALA (American Library Association) don't seem to be invested in this. Is this true or is it just my perception? Is ALA too big and maybe it is better recognized in the smaller divisions like ACRL (Association of College and Research Libraries)? If librarians are to be active partners in DH work, which professional organizations are supporting and investing in this area?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @ethan.watrall's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-tech-would-you-buy-for-a-new-cultural-heritage-informatics-space#post-1000&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Probably too late now but here are a few more ideas: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) Photo GPS tagger device. Lots to choose from, lots of good reviews around.&#60;br /&#62;
2) Bright, versatile, 3D capable 720p projector (i.e. instead of a $$$ 1080p unit). e.g. Dell S300w if you can live with the short-throw. Else a unit that has really good color matching and is native 4:3 (for your art historians..). e.g. Canon's LCOS series. I found Projector Central to be a good resource (esp. their search interface). Shutterglasses.&#60;br /&#62;
3) Don't spend $$ on high-end DSLR. It's cost half as much 2 years later anyway. Instead invest in good tripod and tripod head for VR panoramas. Ideally with horizontal and vertical click-stops (for cubic panoramas) and off-axis correction. Better yet, buy a DSLR with a tripod mount point that is centered on the sensor plane (these days most are). Best get a simple laser based device to measure distance accurately too. Very helpful in the field.&#60;br /&#62;
4). Rotating plate (also with click stops) for Object VRs&#60;br /&#62;
5). Good, neutral cold-lighting kit. These are expensive but very much worth it.&#60;br /&#62;
6). Good quality copy stand. Possible also a book cradle. You might need to ask your friendly theatre or visual art department to build one for you as these are very expensive.&#60;br /&#62;
7). Colorimeter &#38;amp; light meter.&#60;br /&#62;
8). High-quality, large LCD monitors.&#60;br /&#62;
9). 3D printer and scanner.. well, one can dream. The good ones (especially the scanners) are still very expensive.&#60;br /&#62;
10). Good quality video camera with its own tripod w/fluid head. Else a DSLR with good video capture features (think exchangeable lenses..). The Luminous Landscape has some good articles on this.&#60;br /&#62;
11) XBox and Kinect. PlayStation and whatever their 3D gizmo is called. Both for hacking the 3D features. I personally think 3D in cinema is a fad but there's a lot of potential for it in the cultural heritage world.&#60;br /&#62;
12) Wii for hacking the3D features for tactile control (ala Jonnhy Chung).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There, that was fun. cheers.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
