			<description>&#60;p&#62;Returning to this since there are now a lot (and when I say &#34;a lot&#34;... &#60;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software)&#60;/a&#62; of web-based options for project management out there.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've started testing Active Collab (&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.activecollab.com/features.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.activecollab.com/features.html&#60;/a&#62;) and would be grateful for feedback from anyone else who has used this. I'd also love to hear about first hand experience with other alternatives now that 4 years have passed since the question was first posted.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Photogrammetry is great for low-cost architectural/archaeological documentation, but for the type of virtual reality walkthrough exhibited by Williamsburg, the digital Pompeii project at the University of Arkansas, or any of the other projects using Unity, I'd recommend building the 3D models from scratch rather than importing models generated by photogrammetry.  Photogrammetry tends to produce a muddy, higher-polygon-than-necessary result.  It's great for documenting ruins, but not for reconstructions.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Paul,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is actually something I've been kicking for some time. I've had a lot of success modeling extant architecture with photogrammetry, and am a proponent of &#60;a href=&#34;http://ccwu.me/vsfm/&#34;&#62;VisualSfM&#60;/a&#62; (Noah Snavely who does &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/bundler/&#34;&#62;Bundler&#60;/a&#62; highly recommended it). I've also had good success getting models out of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan/standard/&#34;&#62;PhotoScan&#60;/a&#62;, which has a decent user interface for this type of thing. The benefit here is that you can get a textured model out of PhotoScan with a few clicks (and waiting), but you don't have to use additional modeling software to get generate a model. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've seen a lot of people use &#60;a href=&#34;http://unity3d.com/&#34;&#62;Unity&#60;/a&#62; to re-render this for web delivery. This is a technique used by Colonial Williamsburg for their &#60;a href=&#34;http://research.history.org/vw1776/&#34;&#62;Williamsburg 1776&#60;/a&#62; reconstruction of the town during the American Revolution. The down side to this technique (other than being quite resource intensive) is that it requires  a plugin to actually work. I think perhaps a better way to handle this is by leveraging modern browser's capabilities with webGL. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Depending on how &#34;good&#34; you want the render to be, you're going to need to clean the models up in something like 3DStudio Max, Maya, Blender, or any number of other modeling tools. Just a warning, though, if you're new to this kind of software, the learning curve is steep, and the interfaces for these tools take some getting use to.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For web delivery of the models using webGL, there are two main wrappers in major use these days, &#60;a href=&#34;http://threejs.org/&#34;&#62;three.js&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://kineticjs.com/&#34;&#62;kineticjs&#60;/a&#62; (there are others, but these seem to be getting the most traction). Using three.js, the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.chaostoperfection.com/&#34;&#62;Chaos to Perfection&#60;/a&#62; is an amazing interactive &#34;stroll&#34; around Versailles. And the project has an &#60;a href=&#34;http://threejs.org/&#34;&#62;amazing gallery&#60;/a&#62; of example work. For my own work, I've had quite a bit of success with three.js rendering high-poly models quite quickly, but the main issue I've run in to is the fact that a 30Mb texture map still takes a while to download...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For geospatial delivery, I've toyed with a plugin for Omeka that would allow you to add 3D models to items (with an eye toward using them with Neatline). I've been holding off a bit as OpenLayers (the library we use for rendering maps) is going through a major upgrade that will allow you to &#34;easily&#34; tie &#60;a href=&#34;http://cesium.agi.com/&#34;&#62;cesium&#60;/a&#62; to the map, allow you to render terrains (and hopefully models) in 3D without a plugin. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With all that said, here are some other examples of using 3D to help visualize this kind of data:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://mayaarch3d.unm.edu/&#34;&#62;MayaArch&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.kvl.cch.kcl.ac.uk/projects.html&#34;&#62;King's Visualization Lab&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://archive.cyark.org/&#34;&#62;CyArk&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://idialab.org/&#34;&#62;IDIALab&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.byzantium1200.com/index.html&#34;&#62;Byzantium 1200&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dukewired.org/&#34;&#62;Duke Wired&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And, if you're not prone to motion sickness, this is a visualization of 10,000+ images I did of a Spanish Monastery that steps through each image, showing a point cloud, and its shaded and textured surfaces. &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pKOtiQ-ZOI&#34;&#62;Calatrava&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;HTH,&#60;br /&#62;
Wayne

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A colleague of mine has been admiring the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.whatjanesaw.org/&#34;&#62;What Jane Saw&#60;/a&#62; project and has asked for help with an idea for a related immersive web-based gallery based on a historical model. I'm wondering if anyone can recommend similar sites that model gallery spaces or that use architectural models for site navigation and display. (And not Second Life.) There must be great architectural projects and museum sites out there that do this. Grateful for your suggestions.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We're also interested in suggestions for what kinds of platforms or software would be most useful for creating such a web-based project: making an architectural model, overlaying images, providing some kind of spatial navigation, etc. (It seems that What Jane Saw is built from SketchUp models, rendered into background images, and serving room and picture info with PHP and JavaScript.) What approaches would you recommend or avoid? Thanks for your time --
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Hi James, Hi Wayne,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you both. A lot of stuff to mull over here! I'll start with James' AMI and then see what happens from there...

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Shawn,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've used James' AMI on Amazon, and it works like a champ. There's also the OpenGeo Cloud edition, but it starts out around $95/month. One thing about AWS though, it can be a bit confusing, and gets expensive pretty quick if you're doing anything other than your own personal stuff. We have been helping (mostly graduate students) set up James' AMI on EC2 accounts on the dev tier. The awesome thing is that RDS has a dev tier as well, so you don't have to run your database locally.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;VPS solutions are great, and I've used both linode (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.linode.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.linode.com/&#60;/a&#62;) and Rackspace (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.rackspace.com/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.rackspace.com/)&#60;/a&#62;. The  nice thing is that you can (generally) very quickly add more memory/cpu power if you need it.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The tradeoffs here are in the administration of the system. If you're comfortable with configuring and tuning Tomcat, VPS or AWS are a good choice. If you would just as soon not worry about what &#60;code&#62;-XX:+UseParallelGC&#60;/code&#62; does and let someone else worry about that, the hosted solution is a great option.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;James, great AMI by the way. Saves a lot of time remembering the various PHP package names that need to be installed...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Wayne

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A Twitter thread on this topic brought this to my attention. People might find &#60;a href=&#34;http://academicami.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://academicami.org&#60;/a&#62; useful for this. As the site description suggests, the AMIs aren't configured for production sites, but they're fine for getting Omeka + Neatline + Geoserver up and running for familiarisation and testing purposes. People with a few sysadmin skills could harden them easily enough for prod purposes if necessary, I guess. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Geoserver AMI can be found at &#60;a href=&#34;http://academicami.org/category/gis/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://academicami.org/category/gis/&#60;/a&#62;.

&#60;p&#62;Ah, thank you. Acugis looks good, but for the experimenting etc that I'm doing, I don't think I want to be paying $25/month. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A bit of random googling suggested that Amazon Web Services might be a way to go, too &#60;a href=&#34;http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/gettingstarted/latest/awsgsg-freetier/deploy-sample-app.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/gettingstarted/latest/awsgsg-freetier/deploy-sample-app.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;These guys seem to do it too, for cheap- &#60;a href=&#34;https://openshift.redhat.com/app/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://openshift.redhat.com/app/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;...and with dreamhost, one has to switch to their virtual private machine premium service in order to run tomcat. Perhaps that's the simplest option, as I'm already with them...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I do have a spare computer lying around... or rather, I did, but it seems to have died. Darn.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Have you had any experience with AWS?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It's possible to do this, though not recommended. Basically you'll need the the IP address of your work computer and pass that to the NeatlineMaps plugins (e.g. 192.168.1.101:8080/geoserver). This can cause some issues because most likely the IP address of your work computer is dynamically allocated and can change, so you'd need to be updating the location of your Geoserver from time-to-time. There are also institutions that block traffic on certain ports (including port 8080, the default Tomcat port). There are ways around this, but you're getting in to some pretty advanced configuration.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Setting up Tomcat can be quite a pain (I'm not even sure if it's available on Dreamhost), but once you have it running, you can just drop the Geoserver war in your webapps directory. I will note that I'm working with a hosting company (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.acugis.com/&#34;&#62;Acugis&#60;/a&#62;) right now for a one-click installer for Omeka, Neatline, and Geoserver. I was able to set this up even without it in about 5 minutes (but I have &#60;a href=&#34;https://rubygems.org/gems/omeka-recipes&#34;&#62;a lot of scripts to automate this&#60;/a&#62; since I do it so often) on their system.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you do have a spare &#34;server&#34; computer you can use in your office, be sure to check out the OpenGeo suite community edition (&#60;a href=&#34;http://opengeo.org/products/suite/community/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://opengeo.org/products/suite/community/&#60;/a&#62;) which makes installing/managing Geoserver really simple. I'm running this on both Ubuntu and CentOS and it works like a champ (only install the opengeo-geoserver package though). &#60;/p&#62;

&#60;p&#62;Hi Wayne,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you for responding!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My omeka &#38;amp; neatline are on dreamhost. Following the geoserver instructions (and the screenshots on neatline), it looked as if geoserver had to be on my local machine. This struck me as probably wrong, so I looked into putting it onto my server space with dreamhost - which took me to Tomcat, which caused me to melt down in fear...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So I guess I have two tasks ahead of me: installing tomcat on my dreamhost space, and then installing geoserver there too?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Alternatively, can this be done with geoserver running on my office machine? Presumably, it's got to be connected to the internet all the time, ie a proper server...
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Shawn,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Are you trying to you computer using localhost from Dreamhost, or is everything on Dreamhost? If you're trying to point Dreamhost to localhost, you're effectively not leaving your site on Dreamhost and not your local machine. If you have Tomcat running on Dreamhost (if they do that), you might just need to point your NeatlineMaps to your actual domain.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you can provide a few more details, we should be able to help you get up and running...&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Folks,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I want to have neatline (neatline.org) up and running, using a variety of historical maps. Y'know, for kids.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So omeka is installed, check.&#60;br /&#62;
Neatline is installed, check.&#60;br /&#62;
Neatline maps is installed, check.&#60;br /&#62;
Per this page: &#60;a href=&#34;http://neatline.org/plugins/neatline-maps/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://neatline.org/plugins/neatline-maps/&#60;/a&#62; I need to have an instance of Geoserver running. I download it, and successfully get it running on my machine.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;But surely that's a problem, right? Because when I add my server on localhost to the neatline maps server page, my server is always offline. So:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Do I need to have Geoserver on the same server as my omeka/neatline?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And if so, could somebody direct me to a for-idiots guide? My space is with Dreamhost (if that matters).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Shawn

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I run a lot of different Omeka instances and have to do all kinds of crazy deployments and maintenance. I packaged these all up in to a library that you can install (depends on Ruby) called &#60;a href=&#34;https://rubygems.org/gems/omeka-recipes&#34;&#62;omeka-recipes&#60;/a&#62;. You can set up pretty complex server configurations (e.g. staging, production, development) and move databases around with the database tasks. It also has the ability to sync assets (images, etc.), as well as help manage deployments. It may be way overkill for your needs, but for me, it's what I use to manage all of my Omeka instances.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Basic usage:&#60;/p&#62;

cap omeka:sync_assets&#60;/pre&#62;&#60;/div&#62;&#60;/div&#62;



&#60;p&#62;The first command will log on to your sever and generate a backup file for you (reading the db.ini file). The second will download the file to your local machine and the third will download everything in your archive directory to your local computer.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Good advice above. I'll add, though, that if you can back up the archives directory from the Omeka installation itself, it will be very valuable if you ever need it (hopefully not!).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That's because the database dump stores the connection between files and items via its own generated filename -- not what you have in the identifier field. That is, without having the files as Omeka recognizes them in the archives directory, you would risk losing the connection between item, metadata, and file, and would still end up having to recreate the connections. Trust me, this has the potential to make you cry!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, if you use the script Lincoln linked to, modifying it to make sure you grab a copy of the archives directory as well (or the whole kit and kaboodle of your installation) will be very helpful.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Good luck
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The script Lincoln linked to looks very good.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;mysqldump is exactly the command you want for this kind of backup.  It will create a file that contains everything you need to completely restore a MySQL database (the database schema and all your data).  For future reference, it is also possible to have mysqldump return just the data or just the schema.  On the command line type &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;mysqldump --help &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;to see all your options.  (If you've installed MySQL using MacPorts then the command is mysqldump5).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
