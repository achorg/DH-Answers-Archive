&#60;p&#62;I hear you on this; and I don't think it has to be. It's as much teaching undergraduates* how to use the already effective tools that are out there -- how 18th century English Lit studies are changed by the accessibility of ECCO, EEBO, and the Burney Collection,** for example.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;*And even graduate students, staff, faculty, in some cases.&#60;br /&#62;
**Not that I'm blithely assuming that all colleges and unis have access to these tools.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I agree with you that interpretations of textual, visual, geographical, archaeological, etc. data within the humanities are digital humanities.  Almost everything I have done professionally or academically over the last six years has been DH, from GIS to 3D visualization to cultural heritage informatics.  I'm not going split hairs as to whether TEI and data mining are web-based or not, but I find myself increasingly frustrated by conversations about &#34;How do we teach/introduce students to DH,&#34; and all of the answers relate to some form of web development: designing a database schema, learning HTML/CSS.  These are things that are of limited usefulness in many humanities disciplines.  I understand that people will suggest skills based on their own experience, but DH is losing out a lot of experienced technologists and scholars from non-textual fields, and as I have observed DH becoming more and more narrowly focused, voices in the textual humanities fields have greater and greater influence (control, even) over what is or is not &#34;Digital Humanities.&#34;  That is why I suggest that people who call themselves digital humanists ought to reconsider their notion of DH.  I think the field is much bigger than they realize, and thus needs to be more inclusive.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Ethan Gruber's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-do-we-introduce-undergraduates-to-the-digital-humanities/page/2#post-1583&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have to say, I disagree with most, if not all, of this. There is plenty of coding work in DH that is not web-related. Text-mining and distant reading are examples, as is work encoding texts in TEI. I think I remember some very awesome visualizations of ancient architecture, too, that I would call non-web DH coding? :)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The thing that I disagree with most is the idea that we (counting myself as a digital humanist) need to rethink our notion of the Digital Humanities. Like the #transformDH hashtag, it is predicated on a set idea of DH that I do not think exists. It seems like less than a year ago that there was still very active discussion about the role of code in DH, what skills could/should be part of it, and how it all fits together. No one, I think, ever came up with a notion of DH that had widespread consensus as being a good definition. Now, it seems, we are chasing after responses to a non-existent notion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, I do see the existence of two branches of DH, with different histories. In broad strokes, one is the &#34;Humanities Computing&#34; branch, on is indeed the more web-oriented branch (which shares more in common with ed tech). This has been recounted many times before, sometimes in this very site.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd ask that we all recognize the youth of DH, and this it is -- whatever it is! -- still developing through informal channels like THATCamps and blogs and twitter conversation, and through the institutional decisions made by administrators and through cluster hires. In short, I think it is far too early to say that DH is far too focused on textual disciplines. It might be at present, but the ultimate constitution of DH is still very much to be determined. Awesome visualization and interpretation of data -- textual, architectual, visual, geographical, temporal, archaeological, and more -- through digital/code-based means can and should be part of DH. I consider it to be implicit that it _is_, but maybe hasn't had as much attention as other aspects. Seems parallel to the Theory and DH questions that way?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Is learning to code even important in Digital Humanities?  I argue that it's not.  There are particular technologies that are relevant to various disciplines in the humanities, and web development isn't necessarily one of them (since coding always refers to web development in DH contexts).  Digital Humanities, capital D capital H, is far too focused on the textual disciplines and hardly inclusive of the humanities as a whole.  Digital Humanists ought to reconsider their notion of the Digital Humanities.  If you wonder why computer scientists are reluctant to get involved in Capital D Capital H, it's for this reason.  There are actually a great many computer scientists involved elsewhere in the humanities.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for all the great answers!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To update this forum, two of the respondents (Brian Croxall and Jeff McClurken) along with Ryan Cordell spoke about &#34;Teaching DH 101: Introduction to the Digital Humanities&#34; for NITLE's Digital Scholarship Seminars in December.  You can access the recording from the event website:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This seminar prompted a couple of posts on the NITLE blog because the presenters didn't really address coding for undergrads.  Here are a couple of posts that adress that issue:&#60;br /&#62;
Can Humanities Undergrads Learn to Code? by undergrads who learned to code in a humanities course at Pitt &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#60;/a&#62; (The answer is yes!!)&#60;br /&#62;
More Coding for Humanities Undergrads by Kathryn Tomasek, Wheaton College (again yes!!) &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am in the process of forming a DH reading group of &#34;essential&#34; and canonical texts for an informal  student reading group at the iSchool-UMD/CP. This discussion has been invaluable. Thanks. BTW our group is starting with Matthew Kirschenbaum's &#34;Mechanisms&#34;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I definitely would recommend Willard McCarty's stimulating views:&#60;br /&#62;
- Willard McCarty, &#34;Humanities Computing&#34;, Houndmills, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan, 2005.&#60;br /&#62;
- Willard McCarty, &#34;Attending from and to the machine&#34;, Inaugural Lecture, Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College, London, 2010.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Classics being a dynamic field in which general DH questions are discussed, I think the following reference could be suggested (even by one the editors of the book?):&#60;br /&#62;
- Melissa Terras &#38;amp; Gregory Crane (ed.), &#34;Changing the Center of Gravity. Transforming Classical Studies Through Cyberinfrastructure&#34;, Piscataway, Gorgias Press, 2010.&#60;br /&#62;
Along the same lines, Alison Babeu's CLIR report &#34;Rome Wasn't Digitized in a Day: Building a Cyberinfrastructure for Digital Classicists&#34; will be extremely relevant in its final form.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;As an undergraduate, I approach this with a different perspective albeit slightly skewed due to where I study.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I was first introduced to a digital humanities tool in my basic writing seminar Freshman year, Spring 2007. The primary goal of the course was to create a research paper on an aspect of The Great Gatsby. My prof. recommended the use of Zotero. This requirement opened the gateway of what exactly is possible.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Personally, I feel that Zotero should be a commonly known resource among undergraduate students; however, most that I associate with have no clue about it. As an English major, I hate to say that it may be a downfall of our basic Composition courses. Who does it fall on to teach students in their beginning semester how to research beyond google? AND make the most of this researching time?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With the influx of Blackboard and Angel sites for classes, the opportunity to open student's eyes to digital humanities is much greater. Recommending links to collaborative sites that offer more information than google ever will. Also, offering links to free downloadable tools that students are not aware of.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Most undergrads are coming out of a generation that does not know what it is like to be without a laptop, wireless internet, or a cell phone. A lot of students are very open to the ideas behind digital humanities to an extent where it could easily be incorporated. Quite frankly, a discussion based around social networking, microblogging, et als effects on humanities most likely will engage more students. It may potentially pull them away from facebook chat long enough to pay attention.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is a terrific thread.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I integrate DH style assignments into several of my classes, but my favorite class in a seminar of juniors and seniors called Adventures in Digital History in which the students actually do some DH of their own.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In this course they are split up into groups, given broad topics, introduced to a &#34;digital toolkit&#34; of open-source tools, and then asked to design and build their own digital history projects.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The course sites can be found (along with links to each students own narrative project blogs and the projects themselves) for &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhistory.umwblogs.org/&#34;&#62;2008&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://dh2010.umwblogs.org/&#34;&#62;2010&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[The question of a DH-undergraduate curriculum came up at the 2010 THATCamp Prime -- the notes from that session are &#60;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AaEG5-WveNQ3ZGR6M3I4a3pfNjVnZ2ptNzRmMw&#38;amp;hl=en&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.]

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have never taught a course specifically focused on the digital humanities. But I really enjoy inserting a few DH-lite assignments into my regular courses. The goal is to get students &#60;a href=&#34;http://chnm2010.thatcamp.org/05/21/teaching-students-transferable-skills/&#34;&#62;transferable digital skills&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With that, I offer my survey classes a chance to build a collaborative timeline. You can find my assignment--which is adapted from one by &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/jbj&#34;&#62;Jason B. Jones&#60;/a&#62; at my blog: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/02/03/assignment-the-american-century-geospatial-timeline/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/02/03/assignment-the-american-century-geospatial-timeline/&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For my course on media theory, I asked them to crowdsource an annotated bibliography of articles on media theory and related to the texts we were reading. That assignment is available at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/01/18/final-annotated-zotero-group-bibliography-assignment/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/01/18/final-annotated-zotero-group-bibliography-assignment/&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks all for sharing your ideas here. It's giving me ideas about what I could do the next time I start teaching.
