			<description>&#60;p&#62;This question is really fascinating (especially since I suspect I have inkling of &#60;a href=&#34;http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/&#34;&#62;the sort of texts&#60;/a&#62; you're interested in). Let me just dump a handful of links which I think might be helpful from my recent delicious/pinboard (hmm... delicious pinboard).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While I can't point to specific results/papers. Aditi Muralidharan (@silverasm)'s WordSeer project is promising interesting results about slave narratives, though it does not rely on TEI. In &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aditi/projects/wordseer.html&#34;&#62;this talk&#60;/a&#62;, though, she does a good job of answering Sean's question directly--how can metadata improve on generic full-text search. WordSeer (as I understand it) works mostly by supplementing raw text with part of speech tagging and other grammatical metadata.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With respect to TEI specifically one obvious place to start, I think, is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.monkproject.org/&#34;&#62;MONK&#60;/a&#62;; as Dorothea notes, Martin Mueller is involved with the MONK project. You can find him summarizing MONK &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cocoon/tei2008/programme/abstracts/abstract-169.html&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62; and at greater length &#60;a href=&#34;https://apps.lis.illinois.edu/wiki/display/MONK/Notes+towards+a+user+manual+of+Monk&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;. Unlike WordSeer, the Monk Workbench gives you metadata about author (including gender) and publication date. Matt Kirschenbaum mentions MONK in &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~hillol/NGDM07/abstracts/talks/MKirschenbaum.pdf&#34;&#62;this article&#60;/a&#62; [PDF].&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(How relevant it will be to you, I don't know, but when I heard John Unsworth speak recently, he talked about the work flow and complications of large text collections with different encoding standards--with reference to MONK in particular. You can hear him &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.scholarslab.org/podcasts/unsworth-idiosyncrasy-at-scale/&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There was a &#60;a href=&#34;http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1104&#38;amp;L=TEI-L&#38;amp;F=&#38;amp;S=&#38;amp;O=T&#38;amp;H=0&#38;amp;D=0&#38;amp;T=1#34&#34;&#62;recent discussion&#60;/a&#62; on the TEI list about eXist from which I learned a lot--again, about what's possible rather than specific results/reports.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Finally--this one is also not TEI specific--if you haven't seen Ben Schmidt's blog, he is doing some pretty impressive stuff. This post, on &#60;a href=&#34;http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/04/age-cohort-and-vocabulary-use.html&#34;&#62;vocabulary use and age cohort&#60;/a&#62; gives some idea.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I might sharpen the question further by trying to differentiate between texts that have digitally archived and those have been marked-up using the TEI standards.  That is, what kind of discoveries or scholarly innovations has the tagging process itself helped to create that wouldn't have been accessible to more generic full-text searching and/or processing?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;People to start with here would certainly include Martin Muller. The &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.nines.org/publications&#34;&#62;NINES project&#60;/a&#62; may also be a fruitful source.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I suggest, actually, that you dig up some TEI-encoded corpora and trace them through the literature. Offhand, the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.umich.edu/tcp/&#34;&#62;Text Creation Partnership&#60;/a&#62; and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.wwp.brown.edu/&#34;&#62;Brown Women Writer's Project&#60;/a&#62; should have spawned a fair amount of scholarship by now.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I second the copyright concerns. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've worked for years digitizing periodicals, and as far as OCR goes, you can't find a better program than ABBYY FineReader Professional. You can only get it for Windows, so if you are using a mac, install bootcamp and run it from a Windows partition. (do not use the mac version, it is not powerful enough yet). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The reason ABBYY is so good, is that it is spectacular recognizing small text. This trait alone will save you hours of correction. Also, it allows you to export to HTML, XML, text-under-image PDF, etc.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello, DHers,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm writing a report on the TEI in literature, and I'm looking for &#34;discoveries&#34; made in your research using TEI-encoded texts. We've heard of research in the popular press utilizing Google's n-grams, as well as other &#34;text only&#34; archives. I'm looking for research/discoveries accomplished using the TEI standard specifically. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you've made such a discovery, what was it, and what program did you use/create in the making of said discovery? Was this research published? If not, why? If so, where did you publish? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you for your input!&#60;br /&#62;
M.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Omeka's a great option for a more exhibit-style approach, but there are loads of other options if you're interested in partnering with a library.  As mentioned, Chronicling America is a great place to start. It's built from a major NEH + Library of Congress project, the National Digital Newspaper Program. For it,  pre-1923 papers are being digitized in massive numbers so if any of your grandfather's columns are pre-1923, then they might already be included in those projects which are done by state. If they're later, lots of states are currently grappling with how to preserve and make accessible more recent news, including born digital newspapers currently being published. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With all of this work going on, the best option could be to partner with a library to digitize the full 35 year run for the full paper. Even if the library partner can't partner for the full project, they can probably help with the OCR process (running the columns during off-cycle times) if that's helpful. Partnering with a library also means they can benefit from integrating the columns in a full newspaper digital library and they can ensure preservation. Libraries can also help with any copyright questions for the full newspaper and/or individual columns.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If dealing with the paper in print, be very careful if it's actually moldy because it can be a major health hazard (libraries digitize moldy papers with great caution - masks, hepa filters, special disposal to prevent contamination, etc). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm happy to help in general if I can, and there could be a collaborative opportunity if you're grandfather's columns are from Florida or the Caribbean (I'm the technical director for the Florida Digital Newspaper Library and the Caribbean Newspaper Digital Library: &#60;a href=&#34;http://ufdc.ufl.edu/newspapers&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://ufdc.ufl.edu/newspapers&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://dloc.com/cndl&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dloc.com/cndl&#60;/a&#62; ). &#60;/p&#62;

&#60;p&#62;If I were you and it was my family--and if some fairly naive assumptions about the obviousness of chronological organization and accessibility of the material hold--here's what I would do:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;0: Get my copyright ducks in a row -- find out who owns the copyrights to the columns.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1: Scan the columns, being fairly careful to make sure that separate pages of the same column remain together and are differentiated from other columns.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2: Upload the scans to the Internet Archive's Community Texts project, taking some care with the metadata so that the resulting pages are well organized on the Archive.org servers.  Part of the Internet Archive's derivation process involves OCR, so you'll end up with page images hosted (for free!), as well as searchable PDFs, DjVu files and eText formats.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;3: Move the derivative DjVu files to WikiSource, setting up a private instance of your own if the English-language community rules are too limiting.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;4: Enlist friends and family to correct and proofread the OCR using the built-in Wikisource ProofreadPage plugin.  This will track workflow, allow you to flag columns for review, and display how much of the collection has been reviewed.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;5: Use the built-in coolness of MediaWiki to do neat things with the column.  If you're using en.wikisource.org, you can place all the columns into a category and then use the &#34;Make a book&#34; feature to generate publish-on-demand collections of the columns.  (I've tried this with Wikipedia's cognate tool and was blown away by the quality and cost.)  If you're running your own private instance of wikisource, you can hack away with the MediaWiki toolset however you like -- annotating entries in-line using wikilinks, categorizing the columns by subject, mining the mark-up a la DBPedia, or whatever else you come up with.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm sure that other folks will have their own suggestions, but this might be an easy way to leverage to existing tools and the communities that are built around them.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
