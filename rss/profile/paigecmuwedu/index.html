&#60;p&#62;I hear you on this; and I don't think it has to be. It's as much teaching undergraduates* how to use the already effective tools that are out there -- how 18th century English Lit studies are changed by the accessibility of ECCO, EEBO, and the Burney Collection,** for example.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;*And even graduate students, staff, faculty, in some cases.&#60;br /&#62;
**Not that I'm blithely assuming that all colleges and unis have access to these tools.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I agree with you that interpretations of textual, visual, geographical, archaeological, etc. data within the humanities are digital humanities.  Almost everything I have done professionally or academically over the last six years has been DH, from GIS to 3D visualization to cultural heritage informatics.  I'm not going split hairs as to whether TEI and data mining are web-based or not, but I find myself increasingly frustrated by conversations about &#34;How do we teach/introduce students to DH,&#34; and all of the answers relate to some form of web development: designing a database schema, learning HTML/CSS.  These are things that are of limited usefulness in many humanities disciplines.  I understand that people will suggest skills based on their own experience, but DH is losing out a lot of experienced technologists and scholars from non-textual fields, and as I have observed DH becoming more and more narrowly focused, voices in the textual humanities fields have greater and greater influence (control, even) over what is or is not &#34;Digital Humanities.&#34;  That is why I suggest that people who call themselves digital humanists ought to reconsider their notion of DH.  I think the field is much bigger than they realize, and thus needs to be more inclusive.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Actually, all this is very useful, both in confirming the use of what my colleagues and I have in mind, and as a reminder of the value of small things (like plus and minus operators, and Ctrl+F).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The introducing undergraduates in DH thread is also relevant. What I'm looking at is a series of 6 workshops over a three-quarter academic year: 1) providing an overview to major fields/subfields/concerns in DH, and examples of what people are doing; 2) managing your professional identity online; and the other four designated towards giving people brief but well-supported intros to tools and approaches.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While we obviously can't teach people everything, all indications from our preliminary research is that DH is so opaque that it's hard for outsiders to know how to even start asking questions or looking to self-educate (as Peter K. Power's blog post seems to indicate).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In short: thanks, all! This is excellent info to work with.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have found that it is pretty easy to start conversations around simple digital techniques or tools that can make almost anyone's online life better.  For example, something as simple as showing someone how to use &#60;a href=&#34;http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#38;amp;answer=136861&#34;&#62;plus and minus operators in a Google search&#60;/a&#62; can be quite empowering.  Depending on the user, learning that a browser can have multiple tabs open might be a revelation.  Just be non-threatening :) and keep telling people they can do it.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It might also be worth reading the &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-do-we-introduce-undergraduates-to-the-digital-humanities&#34;&#62;How do we introduce undergraduates to digital humanities&#60;/a&#62; thread.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One of the difficulties is that digital humanities covers such a wide range of knowledge and skills that you'd really need to narrow things down to choose an entry point. For example, I came into DH via educational technology, so my starting point was in tool building and site building. For that, I good entry point was just to install WordPress, Omeka, and Drupal someplace and build a site, maybe hack on the themes and code.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As Scott mentioned, there is also a lot of GIS work being done. Not knowing much about GIS, I'm not sure what a suitable entry point is (though I guess that finding an ArcGIS tutorial or class would be a start).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Same with things like distant reading or &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining&#34;&#62;text-mining&#60;/a&#62; or data visualization.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That's all completely unhelpful, I know. Maybe an alternate step back is to lurk and listen to the online conversations that touch on digital humanities until a topic comes up that sounds interesting, and try to ask about the details in that conversation?

&#60;p&#62;Paige, you might send the to Peter K. Power's recent blog on this: &#60;a href=&#34;http://readwritenow.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/literacy-in-the-digital-humanities-or-being-clueless-in-digital-academe/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://readwritenow.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/literacy-in-the-digital-humanities-or-being-clueless-in-digital-academe/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We had a ravenous Twitter conversation about this over weekend that was Storified by Jesse Stommel and might be helpful: &#60;a href=&#34;http://storify.com/Jessifer/the-anatomy-of-digital-humanities-and-digital-peda&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://storify.com/Jessifer/the-anatomy-of-digital-humanities-and-digital-peda&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.wordle.net/&#34;&#62;Wordle&#60;/a&#62; is without a doubt the best gateway drug I have come across for anyone wishing to play with a tool. Learning some basic HTML/CSS for web authoring is also beneficial as a tool for teaching the principles of markup languages. What these have in common is that they provide the beginner with instant (or near instant) gratification that they produced something. Once they begin to run up against (and become conscious of) some of the limitations of Wordle and markup for the web, they can start thinking about more powerful tools like MALLET or more complext markup languages like TEI/XML. But they'll have the confidence to push themselves in that direction. Of course, text encoding and analysis are generally cited as the most intimidating aspects of the digital humanities. Perhaps there are other aspects (GIS? Databases?) which should also be considered.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working on a project aimed at providing training/info to humanities people (grad students, PhDs, staff, faculty, etc.) who feel daunted by the field/like they know nothing, and don't even know where to begin, so I'm interested in hearing about anything that was instrumental in making people feel autonomous enough that they could start exploring and developing their skills independently. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks in advance!

&#60;p&#62;I have to say, I disagree with most, if not all, of this. There is plenty of coding work in DH that is not web-related. Text-mining and distant reading are examples, as is work encoding texts in TEI. I think I remember some very awesome visualizations of ancient architecture, too, that I would call non-web DH coding? :)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The thing that I disagree with most is the idea that we (counting myself as a digital humanist) need to rethink our notion of the Digital Humanities. Like the #transformDH hashtag, it is predicated on a set idea of DH that I do not think exists. It seems like less than a year ago that there was still very active discussion about the role of code in DH, what skills could/should be part of it, and how it all fits together. No one, I think, ever came up with a notion of DH that had widespread consensus as being a good definition. Now, it seems, we are chasing after responses to a non-existent notion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, I do see the existence of two branches of DH, with different histories. In broad strokes, one is the &#34;Humanities Computing&#34; branch, on is indeed the more web-oriented branch (which shares more in common with ed tech). This has been recounted many times before, sometimes in this very site.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd ask that we all recognize the youth of DH, and this it is -- whatever it is! -- still developing through informal channels like THATCamps and blogs and twitter conversation, and through the institutional decisions made by administrators and through cluster hires. In short, I think it is far too early to say that DH is far too focused on textual disciplines. It might be at present, but the ultimate constitution of DH is still very much to be determined. Awesome visualization and interpretation of data -- textual, architectual, visual, geographical, temporal, archaeological, and more -- through digital/code-based means can and should be part of DH. I consider it to be implicit that it _is_, but maybe hasn't had as much attention as other aspects. Seems parallel to the Theory and DH questions that way?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Is learning to code even important in Digital Humanities?  I argue that it's not.  There are particular technologies that are relevant to various disciplines in the humanities, and web development isn't necessarily one of them (since coding always refers to web development in DH contexts).  Digital Humanities, capital D capital H, is far too focused on the textual disciplines and hardly inclusive of the humanities as a whole.  Digital Humanists ought to reconsider their notion of the Digital Humanities.  If you wonder why computer scientists are reluctant to get involved in Capital D Capital H, it's for this reason.  There are actually a great many computer scientists involved elsewhere in the humanities.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for all the great answers!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To update this forum, two of the respondents (Brian Croxall and Jeff McClurken) along with Ryan Cordell spoke about &#34;Teaching DH 101: Introduction to the Digital Humanities&#34; for NITLE's Digital Scholarship Seminars in December.  You can access the recording from the event website:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This seminar prompted a couple of posts on the NITLE blog because the presenters didn't really address coding for undergrads.  Here are a couple of posts that adress that issue:&#60;br /&#62;
Can Humanities Undergrads Learn to Code? by undergrads who learned to code in a humanities course at Pitt &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#60;/a&#62; (The answer is yes!!)&#60;br /&#62;
More Coding for Humanities Undergrads by Kathryn Tomasek, Wheaton College (again yes!!) &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;As an undergraduate, I approach this with a different perspective albeit slightly skewed due to where I study.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I was first introduced to a digital humanities tool in my basic writing seminar Freshman year, Spring 2007. The primary goal of the course was to create a research paper on an aspect of The Great Gatsby. My prof. recommended the use of Zotero. This requirement opened the gateway of what exactly is possible.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Personally, I feel that Zotero should be a commonly known resource among undergraduate students; however, most that I associate with have no clue about it. As an English major, I hate to say that it may be a downfall of our basic Composition courses. Who does it fall on to teach students in their beginning semester how to research beyond google? AND make the most of this researching time?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With the influx of Blackboard and Angel sites for classes, the opportunity to open student's eyes to digital humanities is much greater. Recommending links to collaborative sites that offer more information than google ever will. Also, offering links to free downloadable tools that students are not aware of.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Most undergrads are coming out of a generation that does not know what it is like to be without a laptop, wireless internet, or a cell phone. A lot of students are very open to the ideas behind digital humanities to an extent where it could easily be incorporated. Quite frankly, a discussion based around social networking, microblogging, et als effects on humanities most likely will engage more students. It may potentially pull them away from facebook chat long enough to pay attention.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is a terrific thread.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I integrate DH style assignments into several of my classes, but my favorite class in a seminar of juniors and seniors called Adventures in Digital History in which the students actually do some DH of their own.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In this course they are split up into groups, given broad topics, introduced to a &#34;digital toolkit&#34; of open-source tools, and then asked to design and build their own digital history projects.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The course sites can be found (along with links to each students own narrative project blogs and the projects themselves) for &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhistory.umwblogs.org/&#34;&#62;2008&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://dh2010.umwblogs.org/&#34;&#62;2010&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[The question of a DH-undergraduate curriculum came up at the 2010 THATCamp Prime -- the notes from that session are &#60;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AaEG5-WveNQ3ZGR6M3I4a3pfNjVnZ2ptNzRmMw&#38;amp;hl=en&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.]

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have never taught a course specifically focused on the digital humanities. But I really enjoy inserting a few DH-lite assignments into my regular courses. The goal is to get students &#60;a href=&#34;http://chnm2010.thatcamp.org/05/21/teaching-students-transferable-skills/&#34;&#62;transferable digital skills&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With that, I offer my survey classes a chance to build a collaborative timeline. You can find my assignment--which is adapted from one by &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/jbj&#34;&#62;Jason B. Jones&#60;/a&#62; at my blog: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/02/03/assignment-the-american-century-geospatial-timeline/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/02/03/assignment-the-american-century-geospatial-timeline/&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For my course on media theory, I asked them to crowdsource an annotated bibliography of articles on media theory and related to the texts we were reading. That assignment is available at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/01/18/final-annotated-zotero-group-bibliography-assignment/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/01/18/final-annotated-zotero-group-bibliography-assignment/&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks all for sharing your ideas here. It's giving me ideas about what I could do the next time I start teaching.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In December of 2001, the Wheaton College (Norton, MA) faculty voted to &#34;teach together&#34; in various combinations. This unique alternative to a list of requirements provides an exciting way to explore different areas of knowledge and different approaches to problems. Courses are linked across any two of six academic areas: creative arts, humanities, history, math and computer science, natural sciences, and social sciences. Pairs of connected courses may be taken in either order and do not need to be taken in consecutive semesters, although departmental planning across campus attempts to offer each course of a connection within a year of the other.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;Computing for Poets&#34; (COMP 131) is connected with two courses in English: &#34;Anglo-Saxon Literature&#34; and &#34;J.R.R Tolkien&#34;. For example, in the connection with Anglo-Saxon Literature, the relationship between Old English poems has been a vexed question for nearly 150 years. Because students may take the courses in either order, both English and Computer Science faculty participate in syllabus design and make several guest lectures in the other course to help reinforce the connection between the disciplines. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For students majoring in the humanities and taking the computer science course, an exposure to the application of computers to manage the storage and retrieval of written texts shows by example the many new opportunities for scholars of ancient and other written works. In particular, the &#34;Poets&#34; course teaches computer programming as a vehicle to personalize the exploration of vast collections of poems and corpora now available online, including stylometry and authorship attribution. Course work includes a rich exposure to pattern matching with regular expressions, parsing large collections of XML files (e.g., corpora marked up according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) schema), building a concordance, examining the top-N words in your own writing, and elementary statistical methods for authorship attribution. &#60;/p&#62;
