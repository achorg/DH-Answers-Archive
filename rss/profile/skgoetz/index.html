			<description>&#60;p&#62;An update to my own earlier comment and a partial reply to Wally Grotophorst's: I have since had cause to use Sigil to &#60;em&#62;correct&#60;/em&#62; the imperfect epub export produced by current Calibre. I would very much recommend Sigil over Calibre for epub2 at this point. (The document in question was a &#34;reprint&#34; collection of stories, poems, and review essays for a webzine, and thus with some visual complications--indented lines of verse--as well as structural requirements analogous to a chaptered book's.)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Amazon sells books in print and in formats that can be read by Amazon Kindle devices.  Sound and film obviously cannot be in a print book, and I believe that the Kindle formats do not yet support these either.  (On the other hand, iBooks Author allows you to create ebooks with these types of media, but then they can be used on Apple, not Amazon, devices.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So you will need to determine whether you are willing to omit some of your content in the version sold on Amazon in order to reach the audience found there.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear kevin,&#60;br /&#62;
Thanks for your kind reply. My project cover both cases, yes I want to provide it on amazon and also have some part of that (not all pages) as project online. But have it as a book on amazon is the main aim.&#60;br /&#62;
Thanks again for your helps.&#60;br /&#62;
Best&#60;br /&#62;
Pedram

			<description>&#60;p&#62;On Miriam's original question on this thread, if you aren't in a position to start with webpages or TEI and want to be able to work with things more visually, see &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_desktop_publishing_software&#34;&#62;Wikipedia's list of free desktop publishing software&#60;/a&#62;.  Some of these may be able to produce EPUB files as InDesign can, and they may let you embed multimedia content.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The easy-to-use tool for creating multimedia ebooks is iBooks Author, but your content is then locked into Apple's proprietary flavor of EPUB or in PDF and can only be read on an iPad.  See &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.publishing.umich.edu/IBooksAuthor&#34;&#62;our guide to iBooks Author&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for Pedram's recent question on this thread, there is no simple answer here.  Answers to a few questions will help guide you in the right direction:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;a) Do you need for this book to be sold as an e-book on Amazon, in the iBook Store, or in another retail outlet?  Or are you content to put files on your own website and let people download from there?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;b) Do you need for a user to be able to read the book on an e-reader, or is it okay to require them to have a web browser?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone,&#60;br /&#62;
I am a visual anthropologist and want to know if you can advise me which way is better for me to publish one of my research projects electronically.&#60;br /&#62;
My work is about material culture and their technics of production. Therefore in my book I will have texts, photos, maps, sounds, films and because of the nature of my research I need to create links between all of this. But please don’t forget my target are mostly social scientists: anthropologists, archaeologists, sociologists,…&#60;br /&#62;
So can you kindly let me know what is your feedback? Shall I use one of the ready programs which we can find on the net or I should find someone to write such program for my publication project.&#60;br /&#62;
Thanks in advance for your kind supports.&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Belatedly, since I was checking to see what the current received wisdom is: character entities in P4 are also handy for glyphs for which no Unicode exists (yet?). Though I like Junicode, I'm leery of pasting in glyphs from its Private Use section. Very much in agreement with @kevin.s.hawkins here, also. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm glad to see @&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/jamesc'&#62;jamesc&#60;/a&#62;'s reminder about oXygen's code templates, at any rate, and will define a few templates for the glyphs in my manuscripts which aren't satisfied by the many Unicode hex points I've memorized....

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I just discovered that Apple's Pages can export documents into .epub (in that sense it's a similar suggestion to Scrivener, which I'll have to try out next). I've tested the Pages epub export feature with text documents that included images, tables and footnotes - all were converted into epub without issues (i.e. I confirmed that it looked and worked as expected on an iPhone, with the Adobe Digital Editions app and that the files could be opened with Calbre and Sigil). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[Update] I see that there is an excellent discussion of the pros and cons of exporting epub from &#60;a href=&#34;http://blog.threepress.org/2011/06/01/can-an-author-create-an-epub-file-using-normal-tools-part-1-pages/&#34;&#62;Pages&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://blog.threepress.org/2011/06/02/can-an-author-create-an-epub-using-normal-tools-part-2-scrivener/&#34;&#62;Scrivener&#60;/a&#62; on the &#60;a href=&#34;http://blog.threepress.org&#34;&#62;ThreePress Blog&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On a related note, if you're specifically targeting the iphone/ipad I know that there was a session at WWDC 2011 that described best practices for how to create both flowing text and fixed layout (epub based) ebooks (including features like embedded HTML5 video and audio) for these devices. Unfortunately the content of the video &#38;amp; the slides for the session are still under non-disclosure. Check back in a few weeks if you're not a registered Apple developer.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In response to Sebastian, when I said that some people do not put non-ASCII characters into their XML, this was meant simply as an observation of the current state of affairs and is not a recommendation.  That is, I'm trying to explain why some people might say not to do this.  Naturally French speakers creating XML will use their keyboard layout to directly enter characters used in French and will have no trouble reading and proofreading these.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for use of tools, not everyone has full control over the environment in which everyone in their project operates.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd generally second what Sebastian says here. But, I'd also add a software-specific hint:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you happen to be using oXygen then you can do what are called 'code templates'.  This could consist of highly complex markup, or even just a single character.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So for example, although I can go to their character map and find a capital thorn character and click on it I find it easier to create a code template once with a capital thorn and name it THORN and thorn for the lowercase.  That means I can start writing 'thor' and hit control-space to see if there are any templates that this matches and select the one that comes up.  typing tho-ctrl-space-enter is certainly more keystrokes, but much easier than needing to remember unicode code points, and it puts an actual thorn character in there.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One could do the same with mdash or any manner of things.  I realise that is software-specific to a single editor, but any _good_ editor should allow you to do similar forms of abbreviation expansion or something. (So you can probably do something similar in whatever editor you are using.)&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;ach, I should have guessed that would happen. an editor which claimed to HTML but is a pale shadow. My code example should have been&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#38;lt;hi&#38;gt;t&#38;#234;te-&#38;#224;-t&#38;#234;te&#38;lt;/hi&#38;gt;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Would you say the same for someone encoding texts in more or less any European language (let alone the scripts the majority of people in the world read and write)? I don't think French readers would like it if you suggested they write &#60;code&#62;&#38;lt;![CDATA[&#38;lt;hi&#38;gt;t&#38;#234;te-&#38;#224;-t&#38;#234;te&#38;lt;/hi&#38;gt;]]&#38;gt;&#60;/code&#62; in their files and proof-read like that. The case of endash vs emdash vs hyphen vs minus sign may be a special case, I admit.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That there are tools which cannot do UTF-8 Unicode properly is true, but for how long do we have to tolerate the tyranny of old software? that a tool would be Unicode aware, yet not do UTF-8, stretches credibility, and if a tool be not Unicode aware, should we not cast it into the outer darkness?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Some people avoid putting non-ASCII characters into their XML for any of the following reasons:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* The project's encoders or quality-control team have trouble distinguishing between characters with similar glyphs (like the ASCII hyphen and the em dash).  While this can be mitigated by choosing a different font, you don't always have control over the font used if users are working in various environments.  See the next point.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* There are tools in use (text editors, scripts, etc.) that do not read and write Unicode, at least without proper configuration that users might not always remember to undertake.  So if all text is in ASCII (using entity references when not), you ensure fidelity of interchange.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Mneumonic entities (like &#38;mdash;) are easy to proofread but require extra configuration for validation (as mentioned previously in this thread).  Decimal and hexadecimal entity references are always allowed and are functionally interchangeable.  If consulting Unicode charts, hexadecimal entity references are more convenient since they match the Unciode code points.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The best way to do characters like mdashes is surely to just write them in your file in UTF-8. Forget numerical entities, whatever, just put the character in... your editing application is sure to have way of doing it via a character map or menu or the like. Why treat them differently from any other character your normally type?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I favor Unicode numerical entities, because it's less hassle for me than either using entity definitions or using finicky character palettes, but I am a HUGE NERD and have quite a few of the commonest Unicode punctuation codepoints memorized. If you prefer the HTML-ish formulations, Wayne's suggestion above should work just fine.
