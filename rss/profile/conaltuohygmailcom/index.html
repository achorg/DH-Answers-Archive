			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm using the schema at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/xsd/tei_all.xsd&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/release/xml/tei/custom/schema/xsd/tei_all.xsd&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Oddly enough, I am no longer getting validation errors on these attributes, but the modification date of the schema is dated July 2013.  This doesn't make any sense to me.  Thanks for your help, though.  It appears I can proceed with relative coordinates.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Ethan&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You should check the TEI schema you are using if you find real numbers are invalid. You may have a schema that's been customised to only accept integers. The base data type does include real numbers: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-data.numeric.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-data.numeric.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;These are not (necessarily) pixel coordinates; they can often be physical units such as mm. The unit doesn't really matter so long as a common coordinate system is used within the surface.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello Ethan,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Please do send an email to TEI-L raising your concerns.  People do exactly this sort of thing all the time, and such discussions tend to lead to a consensus that what the person is trying to accomplish can, in fact, be done in TEI another way, or it leads to a bug report or feature request for the TEI Guidelines and associated schemas.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If the such a report is not accepted by the TEI's Technical Council (because, for example, they feel that your use of these attributes violates the semantics of those attributes and that those attributes are defined as intended), you would still be free to customize the TEI in order to allow for your desired use.  See &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html#MD&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html#MD&#60;/a&#62; for a discussion of how to do this.  Basically, the TEI's preferred mechanism is that you use the ODD language to document your change and then generate your new schema from this, rather than taking a TEI schema provided by the TEI Consortium and hacking it directly.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am beginning to work on a project digitizing a series of notebooks, and each page in the notebook will contain annotations created by the project archivist.  I am going to be using Annotorious (&#60;a href=&#34;http://annotorious.github.io/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://annotorious.github.io/&#60;/a&#62;) for the annotation engine, following the model of using OpenLayers to annotate zoomable images.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Much to my surprise, TEI can handle the storage of annotations natively within the schema with facsimile and surface elements.  Some use cases are well-documented at &#60;a href=&#34;http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Talks/2009-07-dublin/talk7_facsimile.xml&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Talks/2009-07-dublin/talk7_facsimile.xml&#60;/a&#62;.  However, the attributes designated for storing x and y coordinates of the annotations only accept literal pixel coordinates, i. e., they must be positive integers.  For annotations made in OpenLayers, for example, the x and y coordinates are represented relatively within the bounds of the image, which are dynamically calculated based on the height and width of the source image file.  Therefore, the surface element may appear as follows:&#60;/p&#62;


&#60;div class=&#34;bb_syntax&#34;&#62;&#60;table&#62;&#60;tr&#62;&#60;td class=&#34;line_numbers&#34;&#62;&#60;pre&#62;1
&#60;/pre&#62;&#60;/td&#62;&#60;td class=&#34;code&#34;&#62;&#60;pre class=&#34;xml&#34; style=&#34;font-family:monospace;&#34;&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color: #009900;&#34;&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&#34;&#62;&#38;lt;surface&#60;/span&#62; &#60;span style=&#34;color: #000066;&#34;&#62;ulx&#60;/span&#62;=&#60;span style=&#34;color: #ff0000;&#34;&#62;&#38;quot;-0.86269991934014&#38;quot;&#60;/span&#62; &#60;span style=&#34;color: #000066;&#34;&#62;uly&#60;/span&#62;=&#60;span style=&#34;color: #ff0000;&#34;&#62;&#38;quot;0.34903242955874003&#38;quot;&#60;/span&#62; &#60;span style=&#34;color: #000066;&#34;&#62;lrx&#60;/span&#62;=&#60;span style=&#34;color: #ff0000;&#34;&#62;&#38;quot;-0.053827751&#38;quot;&#60;/span&#62; &#60;span style=&#34;color: #000066;&#34;&#62;lry&#60;/span&#62;=&#60;span style=&#34;color: #ff0000;&#34;&#62;&#38;quot;-0.216358041&#38;quot;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&#34;&#62;/&#38;gt;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/pre&#62;&#60;/td&#62;&#60;/tr&#62;&#60;/table&#62;&#60;/div&#62;



&#60;p&#62;The values of these attributes are invalid according to the schema.  Ideally, I would like to use an official schema.  Are there other semantically acceptable ways to encode these coordinates?  Or should I edit the schema and validate on a local, modified copy?  Furthermore, should I send an email out to a TEI list with this use case?  It seems plausible that other projects may want to annotate images in this way, and perhaps the attributes should be relaxed to accept decimal numbers rather than integers.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;It's worth mentioning that Scripto itself is CMS-neutral (See &#60;a href='http://scripto.org/documentation/about/'&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;). Developers can build their own tools to make it talk with whatever CMS they want. So far, they've built the connectors for Omeka, WP, and Drupal, but more would be awesome.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not sure about Scripto to record TEI, though, since the transcriptions are recorded in MediaWiki.

&#60;p&#62;These are excellent questions, Ethan.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding image importing, at the moment the only transcription tools I know of supporting any sort of integration with external images are Scripto (Omeka, Wordpress, Drupal), FromThePage (Internet Archive), Islandora TEI Editor (Fedora), the (closed-source) BYU Historic Journals project (ContentDM), and Zooniverse Scribe (via deep-linking to any image on the internet, at a per-page level).  This is, in my opinion, a serious and non-trivial problem with all transcription tools -- just last week I talked with a librarian who really wanted to use T-PEN for medieval manuscript fragments, but was going to use Scripto instead, purely because the images were on their Omeka site.  It seems like rather than using the right tool for the job--and my own FromThePage would be just as inappropriate as Scripto for this use--she was using the tool which integrated with her CMS.  The problem is that it's a lot of effort to integrate tool X with CMS Y, and it's not a problem that scales well across either dimension.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not aware of any transcription tools that do linked data at all.  I know that I've looked into it for FromThePage, but those investigations remain just that -- exciting ideas which do not override improvements to the core tool.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding exports, the XML-(or TEI)-native T-PEN and Bentham Transcription Desk should support export of whatever TEI you use to put into them.  Ditto for MOM-CA-based tools like Itinera Nova, Monasterium, Virtuelles deutsches Urkundennetzwerk as well as the Papyrological Editor.  Mind you &#34;should&#34; is my own term -- I don't know if any of these tools actually feature an 'export' button or API.  FromThePage converts transcripts, subjects, indices, and edit histories into one big HTML file for export, with classes which may allow extraction and conversion.  (I explored TEI export in 2009, but at the time had no background in TEI and abandoned the project -- things will be different soon, however.)  I gather that Scripto exports to the CMS which is its database-of-record, and suspect that CrowdCrafting may well have an export feature as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I love your idea of combining annotation and open data -- it seems to come up all the time in conversation these days, but I don't know of any projects which have gotten beyond the idea stage.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sorry, to dredge up an old topic, but are any of the tools listed here capable of importing images from or otherwise interacting with DSpace? FromThePage appears to support some of the annotations that I would like to make about manuscript images, but I want to avoid making duplicates of images, if possible (since various derivatives will already be available in DSpace, should I elect to use it).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, is anyone aware of annotation tools that interact with web services, such as linking manuscripts to resources defined in VIAF or Geonames?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What sorts of export mechanisms are provided by these annotation tools?  Can I export to TEI?  MODS?  Something else?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I envision using an annotation tool in the back-end to generate TEI or some other robust form of metadata with links to thesauri like VIAF, Geonames, or the Pleiades Gazetteer of Ancient Places in order to import a lot of open data for enhanced context, generate maps, etc.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Further to Kevin's suggestion of interp, I'd suggest you look at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#CONOIX&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#CONOIX&#60;/a&#62; which explains how to encode keywords latent in the text, for construction of an index.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Indeed, 'term' isn't appropriate, both because it can only used within paragraphs, quotes, etc., but also because, as in the definition of the element in the Guidelines, it is meant for technical terms.  Instead you should use 'span' or 'interp'.  See section 17.3 of the TEI Guidelines.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for tagging genre, you mean labeling an entire text as being of a certain genre?  If there is only ever one text per TEI document, you can use 'textClass' in the header.  But if your TEI documents contain more than one 'text' or sometimes contain 'floatingText's, with which you also want to associate a genre, you might instead use the ana= attribute on the 'text' or 'floatingText' to point to specific genres mentioned in 'textClass'.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Friendly DHers:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Dynamic Table of Contexts team is developing a semantic tagset that will be used to encode a collection of scholarly essays.&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
We are currently trying to incorporate this tagset, which is largely based off of Orlando’s tagset, into a TEI-based schema. We intend to tag sections of the text (whole paragraphs, single words, etc.) that corresponds to index-like concepts, such as ‘history’ or ‘politics’.&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
To tag these concepts, we have employed TEI’s ‘term’ element. The various semantic categories feature as values of the ‘term’ element, e.g. &#38;lt;term type=”politics”&#38;gt;.&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
The problem with using the ‘term’ tag in this way is that it is unable to handle nested quote tags or paragraph tags. That is, TEI does not allow &#38;lt;q&#38;gt; tags inside a ‘term’ tag, nor does it allow the ‘term’ tag to wrap around a &#38;lt;p&#38;gt; tag. This restricts the ‘term’ tag’s usage. Ideally, we want to be able to identify concepts across paragraphs.&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
We have searched for an alternative to the ‘term’ tag in the TEI catalogue but apart from customizing the schema, we have not found an adequate solution. At this point in the project, we are interested in sticking to the TEI’s standards. Is there a term-like tag in TEI that we have overlooked?&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
We would appreciate some feedback on this issue of semantic tagging in TEI.&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
ALSO, we are interested in tagging instances of genre in the collection, but again, TEI does not provide a ‘genre’ tag. Is there a clear solution here that we have missed?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I don't know of people using YAML for such things, to be honest; ARAIK the usual practice is to use an XML-based markup language such as EAC or TEI.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding the readability issue of XML-based markup languages, partly I think this is just what you're used to, but of course it's not an ideal rendering for notes. Nevertheless, it's very easy to make and link an XSLT or CSS stylesheet to an XML file and use that to format the document more readably. Then it's just a matter of opening the file in a browser to view it, and a text editor to edit it. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Aside from the issue of readability, the advantages of an XML-based format are too numerous to mention.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Apart from EAC which Ben mentioned already, I would recommend you take a look at TEI; specifically the &#34;Personography Module&#34;. See &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERS&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERS&#60;/a&#62; and also see in the formal declaration of the TEI concept of &#34;event&#34;: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-event.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-event.html&#60;/a&#62; and the declarations for &#34;person&#34; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-person.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-person.html&#60;/a&#62; and &#34;faith&#34; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-faith.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-faith.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It's certainly worth studying the EAC and TEI models even if you do adopt a custom YAML-based format for your data, even just so as to be able to export your data in one of those standard formats.

&#60;p&#62;Ben, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've been thinking about how to go about encoding the data too. Vim (EMACS too, probably) has YAML syntax highlighting and other support out of the box. It would be pretty easy for me to create a snippet for a person record and for a conversion block to keep most things standard. Vim seems to have pretty good autocomplete too, so I could probably create a controlled vocabulary list and use that with autocomplete. &#60;/p&#62;

&#60;p&#62;Ethan,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the suggestions of EAC-CPF. I wasn't aware of that standard. I'm intrigued, and will have to investigate it further. I'm a little reluctant to do the encoding in XML, though, since these records have to double as regular notes. Perhaps I'll munge YAML into EAC-CPF at some point.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I think that YAML is an elegant solution here, since this is a file you'll be hand-editing and the data structures themselves are emerging as you create the data.  YAML should be quite easy to programmatically transform into any standard format you want with some ruby data munging scripts.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The only concern I have is that you may end up with a bit too much typing and inconsistent keys.  I wonder if an editor like Emacs has a YAML mode, and if that mode would support auto-completion of keys you've already used?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
