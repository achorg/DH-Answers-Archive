			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much. That post's question seems very similar to mine indeed! I'm just now looking into the replies you've directed me to via CODE4LIB in LISTSERV.  (I had to register first.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One reply mentions Zotero, which some of the above posts suggest. The other replies seem related to library cataloguing purposes and are pretty technical in nature. But I am keeping an open mind.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far I've been doing some practice conversion of my printed entries into Zotero in Firefox. I will be reading up on Drupal, exploring Drupal's Biblio Zotero plug in, etc., as suggested above.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Still open to further suggestions, however.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've just applied for funding this project. Outcome will not be until December. So I expect to be researching possibilities further and, as I say, still welcome further suggestions. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[Update: the link to my website in my first post is no longer active; the archived link is &#60;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20131209052925/http://susanhollismerritt.org/index.html&#34;&#62;susanhollismerritt.org&#60;/a&#62;.]

&#60;p&#62;+1 to Vagrant. Vagrant's portability also means that if lab users get to a good point with a Vagrant instance on a lab machine, they should be more or less able to take a copy of the Vagrant instance with them.

&#60;p&#62;An update to #1 on my list: MAMP Pro 3 (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/&#60;/a&#62;) now lets you spin up a number of CMS sites (most importantly, Wordpress and Drupal) with a few clicks. Another option is to set up Vagrant (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.vagrantup.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.vagrantup.com/&#60;/a&#62;) to quickly and easily set up dev environments (including CMSs) that don't affect the host computer and can be ported to a live site easily (because Vagrant uses virtual machines, it's easier to make your dev and live environments exactly the same as to all those finicky server details like what version of PHP you're running, than it is with MAMP). Vagrant's site has user-friendly documentation, and it would be pretty easy for someone to create a several-step &#34;here's how to create your own Drupal or WP site on this lab machine&#34; flyer.

&#60;p&#62;Just a short follow-up, I have now bundled my snippets into a more complete R package for working with JSTOR DFR data. It takes DFR output and does ngrams, word correlations over time, document clustering and topic modelling (with MALLET or in R, and inlcuding hot and cold topic identification): &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/UW-ARCHY-textual-macroanalysis-lab/JSTORr&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/UW-ARCHY-textual-macroanalysis-lab/JSTORr&#60;/a&#62;

&#60;p&#62;I didn't know about GenSim. What a great library for Python, and the site has some really nice explanatory material on it, too. Thanks for the link.

Thanks very much.  Will be looking into what you (and the others) suggest.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Update: Just a point of information:&#60;br /&#62;
I noticed recently in doing a search via the online edition of ABELL that repeatedly it gives an incorrect publication year for many of the volumes of &#60;em&#62;The Pinter Review&#60;/em&#62;.  (Apparently, its software took as a publication year dates from subtitles of volumes, not from actual publication information provided in printed title pages/copyright pages.  E.g., in the entry for the most current volume, whose subtitle gives the years it &#60;em&#62;covers&#60;/em&#62; as &#34;2009-2011,&#34; the first of those years, 2009, is listed as the date of publication, which is incorrect, since its copyright date is actually 2011 (though it was distributed in 2012).   In the past, I have found other errors in other online databases frequently used by academic researchers (when checked against actual print sources), and I would not want to perpetuate such errors by importing such erroneous data from those databases.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've tried to generate Old English stop word lists for various experiments from time to time, but never to my satisfaction. Spelling variation is a problem, though not as bad as Middle English. But there is also a tremendous amount of homography--so much that it is almost better to generate a list of homographs and tag forms with separate meanings in the source text(s) before doing anything else. After that, you can just generate a list of the most frequent forms in the corpus. You'll probably then have to tailor this list by deleting forms like &#34;wæs&#34; or &#34;cwom&#34; if they're not relevant to your experiment.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you're planning on working in Python anyway, you might want to look at the gensim library: &#60;a href=&#34;http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/&#60;/a&#62; It would let you perform some topic modeling in the code, so wouldn't require the stop-gap between word frequencies and mallet.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I would look at Drupal, too. The Biblio module would allow data entry of each bibliographic record. The Feeds module would allow you to automate the process if you had all the records in a spreadsheet, csv, or some other format. Plus, since you want to control user access to edit the records, Drupal already has that ability built in with user roles. There is a bit of a learning curve, but it seems like the best tool for what you want. I'd also recommend picking up a book on Drupal if the online documentation (which is very uneven) isn't helpful. The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7 is a good reference work. With Views (another powerful Drupal module) you could create custom queries and displays of the records beyond what the Biblio module already allows.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;To Dorothea, Patrick, and Quinnanya (if I may),&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for all these suggestions, and I will be looking into all of them.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;One way would be to export all your digital files to plain text, then regular-expression the living daylights out of them to turn them into RIS or other text- or markup-based format.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Noticing the Export Manager possibilities in EBSCO Host, e.g., I have seen this as a possibility, though with 14 editions of this bibliography published over 25 years the task involves many thousands of entries.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Related is the point:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;A substantial percentage of your bibliographies is probably already indexed in searchable, fielded form via one or another bibliographic database/index.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Many of my entries came from my own searches that precede the existence of online databases like EBSCO, which now includes the online version of the MLA International Bibliography (previously I used printed versions of the latter), and precede the time when library patrons could do online searches themselves (1986-early 90s). [Prior to that I would pay for librarians with access to RLIN, e.g., at Cornell University and other research universities, to do the searches on the institution's fee basis.]&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My entries are not only publications but also productions and that information I compiled from theater programs of those I attended and reading reviews and other articles and advertisements.  The &#34;Harold Pinter Bibliography&#34; includes performances and performance reviews and productions and interviews and other programs broadcast on various media (radio, television, film, [later] podcasts, etc.) From mid 90s on, it does also include web-based or online publications.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Many of the entries that are published in international newspapers and other popular periodicals do originate in somewhat different formats in online databases like LexisNexis; I probably would not have access to their fields.  To work back to my original sources would probably be more time-consuming in some cases than creating the fields needed for my purposes.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In the cases when the original entries (as noted on my notecards and printouts prior to word-processing the entries into a list format) did come from other online databases (post 1980s-early 90s) via ProQuest, EBSCO, InfoTrac, etc. [or have been included in them retroactively], the mark up is probably accessible.  But, again, thousands of entries are involved and working back to where each one of them came from would probably involve conflicting formats of each of the bibliographic databases used over the period of, say, mid 1990s to the present.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;A further question might be what needs to happen with the database once it exists? That is, is it publicly accessible on the web? Available to others for research upon request? Public on the web, but behind some access restrictions?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;p&#62;At this stage, I am uncertain of the answer to these questions. Initially, the idea is to make the full database of over 25 years both publicly accessible (free to users) on the web and also possibly open to editing by password-protected collaborator-compilers for future expansion of the database (bibliography), following whatever format is used for it.  Depending on the costs of the project (if it is feasible), the costs of maintaining it on a server (if not a donated server by a university or library, e.g.) might need reimbursement through voluntary donations and/or subscription.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The 14 previously published editions of this bibliography (as published in separate lists in &#60;em&#62;The Pinter Review&#60;/em&#62;) are not accessible via commercial vendors (like EBSCO, etc.).*  I would prefer to make it publicly accessible (free to users) on the web universally (not limited only to university libraries and other subscribers to the commercial databases).  How it is to be made accessible is something I can deal with once I figure out how to build the database.  It seems that it would be quicker to give the material to a commercial vendor to mark up in ways to make it searchable, but that would not enable me to correct whatever errors occurred in the printing process (post proofs-correction) prior to a mark up that I and my academic collaborators had more control over.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;To make it more accessible on the web, the next step would probably be to import the data into something like Drupal or Omeka. (I know Omeka has a plugin to import from Zotero. Not sure about Drupal).&#60;br /&#62;
The upshot is that depending on how you intend for the data to be used, there might be additional steps after the initial compiling of data.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;Yup, there's a Biblio Zotero module for Drupal that can do an import, then use the display powers of the Biblio module, and its various add-ons.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It is very helpful to have these points, and I will look into what you suggest and keep them in mind in doing so. I am in the process still of exploring the Drupal links given (much of the language used there is over my head at this stage), and I will need some help with understanding them (e.g., consultant[s]).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you all very much again, and I look forward to other comments that may appear here or sources of information that you think I should research.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;*&#60;em&#62;The Pinter Review&#60;/em&#62; is not available online.  Its individual contents (articles and the bibliography: as a publication: author-title-subject[s]) are indexed (mostly) by the MLA International Bibliography.
