			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hmm...sorry if a repost, first attempt failed.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you have access to a plagiarism-detection app, have you tried seeing what that might return? Seems like same or similar algorithms might be appropriate.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been working on a very similar problem with a colleague who wants to identify text reuse among nineteenth-century codes of civil procedure. Here are two sample analyses with code in R, &#60;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/lmullen/24776&#34;&#62;one that calculates similarities between documents and locates them within the document&#60;/a&#62;, and another that &#60;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/lmullen/24945&#34;&#62;creates a comparison matrix&#60;/a&#62; among a small set of documents. The basic method is to break the text up into 5-grams (though this number is arbitrary and could be improved upon) and then calculate the percentage of borrowings and browse them with a keywords-in-context function. The 5-grams work around the problem of minor changes in language or bad OCR. This code is rough still, but for our test corpus of a couple million words, it seems to be performing better than I had expected.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Have you pushed the texts through whatever plagiarism detection apps are available to you (if any)? Seems like those algorithms are close to the ones you are looking for, and so might make a good start.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Browsing the Mathematica online help today, I found that it offers &#60;a href=&#34;http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/SequenceAlignmentAndComparison.html&#34;&#62;several functions for aligning &#38;amp; comparing string sequences&#60;/a&#62;. A web search for #&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/tags/dh'&#62;dh&#60;/a&#62; projects using sequence alignment brought me back here (having completely forgotten that I'd posted a reply to this thread 2 years ago..). See also the following two ARTFL papers &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/conference/programme/abstracts/intertextuality-and-influence-in-the-age-of-enlightenment-sequence-alignment-applications-for-humanities-research.1.html&#34;&#62;one&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/190/235&#34;&#62;two&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;An update to my own earlier comment and a partial reply to Wally Grotophorst's: I have since had cause to use Sigil to &#60;em&#62;correct&#60;/em&#62; the imperfect epub export produced by current Calibre. I would very much recommend Sigil over Calibre for epub2 at this point. (The document in question was a &#34;reprint&#34; collection of stories, poems, and review essays for a webzine, and thus with some visual complications--indented lines of verse--as well as structural requirements analogous to a chaptered book's.)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Amazon sells books in print and in formats that can be read by Amazon Kindle devices.  Sound and film obviously cannot be in a print book, and I believe that the Kindle formats do not yet support these either.  (On the other hand, iBooks Author allows you to create ebooks with these types of media, but then they can be used on Apple, not Amazon, devices.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So you will need to determine whether you are willing to omit some of your content in the version sold on Amazon in order to reach the audience found there.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear kevin,&#60;br /&#62;
Thanks for your kind reply. My project cover both cases, yes I want to provide it on amazon and also have some part of that (not all pages) as project online. But have it as a book on amazon is the main aim.&#60;br /&#62;
Thanks again for your helps.&#60;br /&#62;
Best&#60;br /&#62;
Pedram

			<description>&#60;p&#62;On Miriam's original question on this thread, if you aren't in a position to start with webpages or TEI and want to be able to work with things more visually, see &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_desktop_publishing_software&#34;&#62;Wikipedia's list of free desktop publishing software&#60;/a&#62;.  Some of these may be able to produce EPUB files as InDesign can, and they may let you embed multimedia content.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The easy-to-use tool for creating multimedia ebooks is iBooks Author, but your content is then locked into Apple's proprietary flavor of EPUB or in PDF and can only be read on an iPad.  See &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.publishing.umich.edu/IBooksAuthor&#34;&#62;our guide to iBooks Author&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for Pedram's recent question on this thread, there is no simple answer here.  Answers to a few questions will help guide you in the right direction:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;a) Do you need for this book to be sold as an e-book on Amazon, in the iBook Store, or in another retail outlet?  Or are you content to put files on your own website and let people download from there?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;b) Do you need for a user to be able to read the book on an e-reader, or is it okay to require them to have a web browser?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone,&#60;br /&#62;
I am a visual anthropologist and want to know if you can advise me which way is better for me to publish one of my research projects electronically.&#60;br /&#62;
My work is about material culture and their technics of production. Therefore in my book I will have texts, photos, maps, sounds, films and because of the nature of my research I need to create links between all of this. But please don’t forget my target are mostly social scientists: anthropologists, archaeologists, sociologists,…&#60;br /&#62;
So can you kindly let me know what is your feedback? Shall I use one of the ready programs which we can find on the net or I should find someone to write such program for my publication project.&#60;br /&#62;
Thanks in advance for your kind supports.&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Ethan Gruber's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/collaborative-software-for-transcribing-digital-images-of-handwritten-documents#post-1994&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It's worth mentioning that Scripto itself is CMS-neutral (See &#60;a href='http://scripto.org/documentation/about/'&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;). Developers can build their own tools to make it talk with whatever CMS they want. So far, they've built the connectors for Omeka, WP, and Drupal, but more would be awesome.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not sure about Scripto to record TEI, though, since the transcriptions are recorded in MediaWiki.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Ethan Gruber's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/collaborative-software-for-transcribing-digital-images-of-handwritten-documents#post-1994&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;These are excellent questions, Ethan.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding image importing, at the moment the only transcription tools I know of supporting any sort of integration with external images are Scripto (Omeka, Wordpress, Drupal), FromThePage (Internet Archive), Islandora TEI Editor (Fedora), the (closed-source) BYU Historic Journals project (ContentDM), and Zooniverse Scribe (via deep-linking to any image on the internet, at a per-page level).  This is, in my opinion, a serious and non-trivial problem with all transcription tools -- just last week I talked with a librarian who really wanted to use T-PEN for medieval manuscript fragments, but was going to use Scripto instead, purely because the images were on their Omeka site.  It seems like rather than using the right tool for the job--and my own FromThePage would be just as inappropriate as Scripto for this use--she was using the tool which integrated with her CMS.  The problem is that it's a lot of effort to integrate tool X with CMS Y, and it's not a problem that scales well across either dimension.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not aware of any transcription tools that do linked data at all.  I know that I've looked into it for FromThePage, but those investigations remain just that -- exciting ideas which do not override improvements to the core tool.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding exports, the XML-(or TEI)-native T-PEN and Bentham Transcription Desk should support export of whatever TEI you use to put into them.  Ditto for MOM-CA-based tools like Itinera Nova, Monasterium, Virtuelles deutsches Urkundennetzwerk as well as the Papyrological Editor.  Mind you &#34;should&#34; is my own term -- I don't know if any of these tools actually feature an 'export' button or API.  FromThePage converts transcripts, subjects, indices, and edit histories into one big HTML file for export, with classes which may allow extraction and conversion.  (I explored TEI export in 2009, but at the time had no background in TEI and abandoned the project -- things will be different soon, however.)  I gather that Scripto exports to the CMS which is its database-of-record, and suspect that CrowdCrafting may well have an export feature as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I love your idea of combining annotation and open data -- it seems to come up all the time in conversation these days, but I don't know of any projects which have gotten beyond the idea stage.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sorry, to dredge up an old topic, but are any of the tools listed here capable of importing images from or otherwise interacting with DSpace? FromThePage appears to support some of the annotations that I would like to make about manuscript images, but I want to avoid making duplicates of images, if possible (since various derivatives will already be available in DSpace, should I elect to use it).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, is anyone aware of annotation tools that interact with web services, such as linking manuscripts to resources defined in VIAF or Geonames?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What sorts of export mechanisms are provided by these annotation tools?  Can I export to TEI?  MODS?  Something else?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I envision using an annotation tool in the back-end to generate TEI or some other robust form of metadata with links to thesauri like VIAF, Geonames, or the Pleiades Gazetteer of Ancient Places in order to import a lot of open data for enhanced context, generate maps, etc.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Alex,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is an interesting question. For content that has been digitized, I agree with Bethany that researchers analyzing the corpora of mass digitization projects such as Hathi can begin to look at the &#34;macroscopic sense of bodies of knowledge,&#34; as you write.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For print collections, this is more difficult.  A few things come to mind.  The first is Dan Cohen's discussion of the graphs that Hathi Trust released showing the uniqueness of print holdings in comparison with other Hathi Trust members:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dancohen.org/2012/12/13/visualizing-the-uniqueness-and-conformity-of-libraries/&#34;&#62;http://www.dancohen.org/2012/12/13/visualizing-the-uniqueness-and-conformity-of-libraries/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(Read the update and clarification at the bottom of the post for further pointers and more on the limitations of this visualization.)  It would be neat to be able to have similar graphs available for more libraries, and for specific ranges of holdings within them, e.g., by a particular subject area.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Second, because some of the questions you pose and types of content you list as examples typically relate to archives and special collections, the &#60;a href=&#34;http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/&#34;&#62;ArchiveGrid site&#60;/a&#62; comes to mind.  It does aggregate archival collection descriptions from around the world and allows you to navigate search results by geography, topic, name, and so forth.  Here's an example search result for the keywords &#34;Cuba elections&#34;:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/?q=Cuba+elections&#38;amp;ft=1&#34;&#62;http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/?q=Cuba+elections&#38;amp;ft=1&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Following your example of the New York area collections, you could &#34;Narrow by Archive Location&#34; to &#34;United States - New York - New York&#34; and see a combined search result showing collections from Columbia, NYU, NYPL, and the Center for Jewish History.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
