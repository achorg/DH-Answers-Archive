			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear community,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am intensively testing exports to PDF from TEI documents and can’t figure where could be the problem. The document is always fully valid, CSS rendition (default) work properly. However, in the result there is always missing the label, which is always coded as table’s head.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;code&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
  &#38;lt;table rendition=&#34;simple:frame&#34;&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;lt;head&#38;gt;The head!&#38;lt;/head&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;/code&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have noticed it is really important to test several types of notation when testing outputs via XSLT (e.g. footnotes’ rendition is rather an adventure!) but here I tried almost everything and nothing helps. It seems the &#60;code&#62;tei:head&#60;/code&#62; part from XSL templates is not passed into the final output. In XeLaTeX it worked well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Is there something I am omitting in the code and what Oxygen needs for proper rendition? (like rend=&#34;header&#34; or so?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any help more than welcome!&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks Stéfan. Curiously, I haven't seen your answer before. There is a French app, called Tropes, unfortunately not open source, that can be used (an English version exists). But it is very limited. I'll look at StanfordNLP or NLTK if I can do something with it.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I checked some of the bigger APIs (OpenCalais, AlchemyAPI) and they don't seem overly interested in flexible parsing of dates. If a bit of coding is possible, you might have more luck with GATE or StanfordNLP, and in particular the SUTime module that can be tested here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sutime/process&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sutime/process&#60;/a&#62; (the bad news is that I suspect this language model is limited to English). There's probably an Python NLTK module as well, but nothing I could find after a quick search was particularly well-suited for detecting &#34;traces of time&#34;. Please do let us know if you find something! I could maybe be bribed to look at adding this to Voyant ;)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear all,&#60;br /&#62;
I have a database with more than one million tweets (about WW1). What I'd like to do now is to recognize dates and traces of time.&#60;br /&#62;
Has anyone an idea of how to do this? (In French and English).&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Returning to this since there are now a lot (and when I say &#34;a lot&#34;... &#60;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software)&#60;/a&#62; of web-based options for project management out there.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've started testing Active Collab (&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.activecollab.com/features.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.activecollab.com/features.html&#60;/a&#62;) and would be grateful for feedback from anyone else who has used this. I'd also love to hear about first hand experience with other alternatives now that 4 years have passed since the question was first posted.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Although the question is a few years old, the answers still hold, but the best way is to learn by doing it. Pick a text, pick an editor, and try to mark it up. There are lots of gotchas in XML, but a decent editor will shield you from the worst of them. Unfortunately there are very few free XML editors (Emacs is one, but not recommended for beginners). If trial and error, or a book, is too much, there's always something like the Intro sessions at the XML Summer School and similar events -- &#60;a href=&#34;http://xml.silmaril.ie/moreinfo.html#events&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://xml.silmaril.ie/moreinfo.html#events&#60;/a&#62; (I edit this, so let me know any errors).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I guess this topic was originally posted before I finished my MA. I got my MA in classical archaeology from the University of Virginia in 2013. Instead of a traditional research project, I wrote on the technical underpinnings of the Roman coin projects we are doing at the American Numismatic Society and the application of linked data to the UVA numismatic collection, which was basically the culmination of my academic career up to that point. The digital projects weren't accepted in lieu of a thesis however, and they should not have been. The thesis provided a background of the history of the description of coins from the Renaissance to the database era and beyond, with specific use cases detailing the digital future of the discipline. The thesis was basically the digital state of the field in 2013.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not sure that a written thesis should be removed altogether. &#60;em&#62;Something&#60;/em&#62; should be written to place the project into context.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Do keep in mind that the approach recommended here strips the markup away, leaving only the text in between the tags.  Since the TEI (and other document-based XML languages) generally leave the transcribed text inside tags (rather than as, say, the values of attributes), this approach will work quite well.  But also keep in mind that the TEI has intentionally given up on the naive assumption that if you strip away the markup, you get the exact text that appeared on the page.  For example, the TEI's&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;pre&#62;choice&#60;/pre&#62;
 element includes text between tags for more than one interpretation of what you see on the page, so these two strings will appear in the output of the above command sequences, one after the other, while the source document contained only one of these (though the encoder is unclear on which).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So beware that things like will introduce errors in your OCR training.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much everyone for your help - both techniques worked equally well. I still need to swap some characters and remove line breaks from the processed texts but I can easily batch that in my text editor. Thanks again!

&#60;p&#62;I was going to suggest something similar to Hugh, though the text() syntax doesn't seem to work when I test, but this does:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;pre&#62;xmllint --xpath &#34;string(//*[local-name()='body'])&#34; FILENAME.xml&#60;/pre&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;@&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/cforster'&#62;cforster&#60;/a&#62; is almost certainly right that you want an XSLT. It all depends on the level of encoding and whether you really want all of the text, laid out as it is in the document (maybe there are footnotes in the OCR for example that have been turned into inline notes in the TEI).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, if you really just want a dead-simple text extraction, you can do something like the following with xmllint:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;code&#62;xmllint --xpath &#34;//*[local-name() ='text']//text()&#34; flle.xml&#60;/code&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That can be bundled up with a find command (or other method of iterating over the files) and the output redirected to files in order to do your batch processing.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Well, &#60;em&#62;best&#60;/em&#62; is a tricky one. But if you're comfortable using XSLT this is pretty classic XSLT sort of problem. The default XSLT rules are to essentially output the content of the nodes so a &#60;em&#62;very&#60;/em&#62; simple script could do what you're looking to do (I've done it many times before). Chances are, though, that you are going to want to trip out the teiHeader and just get the body of the text. You can write an empty rule to match the teiHeader, which will have the effect of silencing its output. A simple (though imperfect may to do this would be an XSLT stylesheet something like the following:&#60;/p&#62;


&#60;div class=&#34;bb_syntax&#34;&#62;&#60;div class=&#34;code&#34;&#62;&#60;pre class=&#34;xslt&#34; style=&#34;font-family:monospace;&#34;&#62;&#38;lt;?xml version=&#38;quot;1.0&#38;quot; encoding=&#38;quot;utf-8&#38;quot;?&#38;gt;
&#38;nbsp;
&#38;lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:tei=&#38;quot;http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0&#38;quot;
  xmlns=&#38;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&#38;quot;
  xmlns:xsl=&#38;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&#38;quot; version=&#38;quot;1.0&#38;quot;&#38;gt;
&#38;nbsp;
  &#38;lt;xsl:output method=&#38;quot;text&#38;quot; encoding=&#38;quot;UTF-8&#38;quot; /&#38;gt;
&#38;nbsp;
  &#38;lt;xsl:template match=&#38;quot;tei:TEI&#38;quot;&#38;gt;
    &#38;lt;xsl:apply-templates /&#38;gt;
  &#38;lt;/xsl:template&#38;gt;
&#38;nbsp;
  &#38;lt;xsl:template match=&#38;quot;tei:teiHeader&#38;quot;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/xsl:template&#38;gt;
&#38;nbsp;
&#38;lt;/xsl:stylesheet&#38;gt;&#60;/pre&#62;&#60;/div&#62;&#60;/div&#62;



&#60;p&#62;If you're on OSX, the built-in xslt processor (xsltproc) can handle this. Just save the above XSLT code into a file (call it strip.xsl) and then, at the command line: &#60;code&#62;xsltproc strip.xsl [TEI FILE NAME]&#60;/code&#62;. By default this outputs to standard input (i.e. the screen), but you can pipe it into a file &#60;code&#62;xsltproc strip.xsl [TEI FILE NAME] &#38;gt; stripped.txt&#60;/code&#62;. And at this point if you can write a shell script, it should be possible to loop over all the files in a directory.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
