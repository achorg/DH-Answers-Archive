			<description>&#60;p&#62;In fact, when configuring a journal in OJS, there's an option to say that the OJS is used only for submissions and editorial management but not for actually publishing the journal.  This prevents the &#34;current issue&#34; and &#34;archives&#34; links from appearing in the interface, confusing readers.  See &#60;a href=&#34;http://journal.tei-c.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://journal.tei-c.org/&#60;/a&#62; for an example of an OJS instance that is used for managing submissions but not for actually publishing issues.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here is a list of things that at one point or another struck me as covering editorial management.  Many are not open-source, but I'll let you sort through for anything of interest:&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I don't know about the two WordPress solutions -- though I have been really, really impressed with all the things that can be done, and done well, with WordPress in general -- but I'd like to echo the Open Journal software and its cousins (Open Conference et al.). I've been on the reviewing side of the setup, as well as someone who reads a number of open access journals published using the OJS setup, and I have to say it is very close to painless. Easy to use. Nice outputs.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For WordPress, look into the Atahualpa and Montezuma themes, both of which are specialized for publishing workflows. (Read &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.cetis.ac.uk/philb/2012/03/13/cetis-publications-now-on-wordpress/&#34;&#62;an account of publishing with Atahualpa&#60;/a&#62;.) Having tangled with and bounced off Montezuma, I can say that there's a significant learning/customization curve, but whether it's worth climbing for you is yours to answer.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If PressForward ever gets out of vaporware stage, it too is likely to be worth looking at.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you want to move to Drupal, there's an &#60;a href=&#34;http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/5913&#34;&#62;excellent article in Code4lib Journal&#60;/a&#62; you should read.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You could look into using an instance of Open Journal Systems, an open source management system for peer reviewed journals from the Public Knowledge Project. You'd want it essentially just for its backend management systems not for actually publishing the journal since that's happening through Wordpress. The OJS site and documentation can be found here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Of course, then you have two systems to manage and support.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking into platforms that can be used as an editorial management system for a project I'm providing assistance with. I'm working with a faculty member who is publishing reviews of dissertations with WordPress. The challenge he and his co-editor are having is with their system for keeping track of editors, people contacted for review, and the state reviews are in. They have a large editorial team assigned to specific historical fields, who work directly in finding reviewers and soliciting reviewees. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What they're running up against is tracking all these people. They currently are using Google Spreadsheets to track who has been contacted, who needs contacting, if someone's been contacted and declined review, if someone's been contacted and wants to be reviewed but needs a follow-up, tracking the state of review drafts, and so on. But it's starting to be a pinch point (part of the problem is different field editors can potentially contact the same reviewee or reviewer -- they want something more unified that anyone can query and track statuses). Short of building their own database system to track everyone, are there other solutions that already exist in managing people and content for journals? I've looked at system like Annotum and Edit Flow, but I don't think they're quite what they need. It doesn't need to be built on top of WordPress, either. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any thoughts? Would Drupal serve as a better alternative? Should we build something from the ground-up?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Canadian (well, American-in-Canada) perspective here. DH-in-libraries is still a relatively nascent item, so I for one am focusing regional -- going to THATcamps, doing local evangelism. Our own library based DH centre is still in development, so perhaps when it spins up and things even out a bit there might be a call to think a little more broadly.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A little birdie told me that ALA Midwinter in Dallas will have a panel called &#34;Online and Above the Radar: Ensuring the Use and Discoverability of Digital Collections&#34;, which hopefully will have some Omeka representation, so that's something?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Micah Vandegrift's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/are-library-associations-ignoring-digital-humanities#post-1474&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;RBMS is calling for some pre-conference papers on DH (and I'm submitting with the director of our special collections):  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;RBMS 2012 Preconference Call for Short Papers&#60;br /&#62;
SUBMISSION DEADLINE: December 15, 2011&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;FUTURES!&#60;br /&#62;
53rd Annual RBMS Preconference&#60;br /&#62;
San Diego, California&#60;br /&#62;
June 19 - 22, 2012&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Planning for the 2012 RBMS Preconference is entering the final stages.&#60;br /&#62;
This year's theme is FUTURES! The 2012 RBMS Preconference will explore&#60;br /&#62;
a multiplicity of futures for the rare book, manuscript, and special&#60;br /&#62;
collections community. How are special collections materials being&#60;br /&#62;
discovered and used today? How will they be discovered and used&#60;br /&#62;
tomorrow? Who will our users be, and what will they need? What forms&#60;br /&#62;
will special collections materials take? Join us to learn, discuss,&#60;br /&#62;
share, and contemplate. Now is the time to shape and prepare, because&#60;br /&#62;
the future is now.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Preconference will feature engaging plenaries, educational&#60;br /&#62;
seminars, lively discussion groups, and dynamic short paper&#60;br /&#62;
presentations. Plenary sessions will address three facets of our&#60;br /&#62;
theme:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Use: Digital Humanities&#60;br /&#62;
Discovery: Linked Open Data&#60;br /&#62;
Object: Book&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Clearly there are many, many more aspects of this theme to explore, so&#60;br /&#62;
we invite short paper submissions that address our theme in creative&#60;br /&#62;
and thought-provoking ways. Short papers can be broadly theoretical or&#60;br /&#62;
solidly practical; they can be the result of intense personal research&#60;br /&#62;
or the fruit of a productive collaboration.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A subcommittee of the 2012 RBMS Preconference Program Planning&#60;br /&#62;
Committee will review all submissions and select and organize the&#60;br /&#62;
papers into intellectually coherent clusters of three or four 15 to 20&#60;br /&#62;
minute presentations. There will be one time slot during which four&#60;br /&#62;
short paper sessions will run concurrently.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Proposals of 500 words or less should be sent to Mike Kelly&#60;br /&#62;
(mkelly@amherst.edu) no later than December 15, 2011. Final selections&#60;br /&#62;
by the Short Papers Subcommittee will be announced early in the New&#60;br /&#62;
Year.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Short Papers Subcommittee:&#60;br /&#62;
Mike Kelly, Amherst College&#60;br /&#62;
Melissa Nykanen, Pepperdine University&#60;br /&#62;
Katie L.B. Henningsen, University of Kentucky&#60;br /&#62;
Karla Nielsen, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A Note on Preconference Program Planning: The process of Preconference&#60;br /&#62;
Programming is not always clear to newcomers to the section, and even&#60;br /&#62;
some who have been around for a while. The Preconference Program&#60;br /&#62;
Planning Committee is responsible for the overall theme and schedule&#60;br /&#62;
of the conference, including selecting plenary speakers and organizing&#60;br /&#62;
discussion sessions. Their work began at the 2011 Midwinter meeting in&#60;br /&#62;
San Diego. The Seminars Committee is responsible for development of&#60;br /&#62;
seminars that may, or may not, be directly tied to the Preconference&#60;br /&#62;
theme. The 2012 Preconference will feature ten seminars, some of which&#60;br /&#62;
have been in development for over a year. Short papers are a way to&#60;br /&#62;
open the Preconference to participation from a wider range of voices&#60;br /&#62;
than may be represented in the other sessions on a shorter timeline.&#60;br /&#62;
Those interested in helping to shape the 2013 Preconference, should&#60;br /&#62;
attend the first meeting of the 2013 Preconference Program Planning&#60;br /&#62;
Committee during ALA Midwinter in Dallas.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There was a great deal of emphasis on the digital humanities at DLF's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.diglib.org/forums/2011forum/&#34;&#62;most recent forum&#60;/a&#62;, and the Digital Library Federation has also launched a partnership with &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet&#34;&#62;centerNet&#60;/a&#62;, an international alliance of digital humanities labs and centers, around a set of shared interests:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.diglib.org/community/collaborations/centernet/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.diglib.org/community/collaborations/centernet/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;DLF also sponsored conference registration discounts for a number of first-time librarian attendees at the annual &#60;a href=&#34;//dh2011.stanford.edu&#34;&#62;DH conference&#60;/a&#62; last summer at Stanford, which I thought was terrific.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In general, many librarians are members of the &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org&#34;&#62;ADHO&#60;/a&#62; organizations, including the &#60;a href=&#34;http://ach.org&#34;&#62;ACH&#60;/a&#62; (your friendly hosts of DH Answers!).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Yes, ACRL is the place to look: An ACRL Digital Humanities Interest Group was just launched this fall, and we'll be having our first meeting at ALA Annual 2012.  Also, we are organizing a Digital Humanities and Librarians pre-conference that will be held at ALA Annual 2012, and more details about that will be coming out this spring. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Other library-related organizations that are good places to look at are DLF (www.diglib.org), Council of Library and Information Resources (CLIR, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.clir.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.clir.org&#60;/a&#62;), and the Assocation of Research Libraries, which just published a report on digital humanities centers in libraries at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arl.org/news/pr/spec326-6dec11.shtml&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.arl.org/news/pr/spec326-6dec11.shtml&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Well... here's a further question - where are current DHbrarians investing their professional development at the association level? I'm struggling to reconcile this with the grand idea of the Big Tent (librarianship and DH), and how I want to support it, but my interests in the field are starting out so specialized. I want to invest my time in exciting, new, developing areas. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Will look in to your recommendations, thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;ALA is the wrong level to look at, as you suspected. Watch ACRL. Also keep an eye on the Coalition for Networked Information and the Association for Research Libraries. Another possibility is the academic section of the Special Libraries Association.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There is a lot of talk about the major disciplinary conferences like MLA and AHA having substantial increases in sessions devoted to digital humanities. I am worried/wondering why library associations like ALA (American Library Association) don't seem to be invested in this. Is this true or is it just my perception? Is ALA too big and maybe it is better recognized in the smaller divisions like ACRL (Association of College and Research Libraries)? If librarians are to be active partners in DH work, which professional organizations are supporting and investing in this area?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Why not contact the bloggers and arrange to do this collaboratively? For example, with the WordPress Database Backup plugin, the bloggers could easily have archives emailed periodically to the researchers. Arguably, that's a more ethically sound approach than just slurping someone's site (even if it is public). And the bloggers might be glad to have someone back up their work.
