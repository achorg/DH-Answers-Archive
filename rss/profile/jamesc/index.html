			<description>&#60;p&#62;Belatedly, since I was checking to see what the current received wisdom is: character entities in P4 are also handy for glyphs for which no Unicode exists (yet?). Though I like Junicode, I'm leery of pasting in glyphs from its Private Use section. Very much in agreement with @kevin.s.hawkins here, also. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm glad to see @&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/profile/jamesc'&#62;jamesc&#60;/a&#62;'s reminder about oXygen's code templates, at any rate, and will define a few templates for the glyphs in my manuscripts which aren't satisfied by the many Unicode hex points I've memorized....

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Bethany Nowviskie's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-can-we-improve-the-dhanswers-site/page/3#post-1283&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Aha, yes, I can see the green check mark on the left - I had missed this earlier, thanks (I take it the check mark I see renders a page as green but does not flag the question/topic itself with a checkmark? As in this thread?). I do follow the reasoning behind no best or closed answers. Conceptually, I fully agree. Just, I think I was coming more from a perspective where the presence of a check mark on the DH Answers homepage on just a handful of articles makes it &#34;look&#34; as if the others haven't been answered yet. This is reinforced a little bit (not much, because the link isn't immediately apparent) by the &#34;Questions With No Answers&#34; link at the bottom left under Find Answers. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Another suggestion might be to remove the checkmark to the left of existing articles to avoid creating the impression that some haven't been answered (and not use this feature anymore in the future) but leave in place a means to mark some responses as &#34;green&#34; for exactly the same reasons you cite above. Alternatively, if you do eventually decide to move to a more complex system (DH Answers becomes a victim of its own untamed, untrammeled, runaway success :^) you might want to look at the new Atlassian Q&#38;amp;A site (&#60;a href=&#34;https://answers.atlassian.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://answers.atlassian.com/&#60;/a&#62;) as one possible model. They're using an open-source product from &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.osqa.net/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.osqa.net/&#60;/a&#62; It still looks too fidgety for my taste, but perhaps there's a way to turn off various bells &#38;amp; whistles as needed.

&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the great suggestion about adding multilingual &#34;welcome&#34; posts! I think we should really make this a priority -- and we'll probably need to call for volunteers to help out.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On the question of &#34;best answers&#34; and closed-out versus &#34;open&#34; questions: DH Answers admin and the original poster of each question should have the ability to designate one or more answers in a thread as &#34;best answers&#34; by clicking a &#34;best answer?&#34; link with a little green check-mark next to each post.  If you are not seeing this for questions you posed, please let us know!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We actually decided that we don't want &#34;best answers&#34; in DH Answers to &#34;close&#34; our questions (which is one of the reasons we're using this discussion-forum platform over some other available choices).  Many of the issues being discussed here will never have a single, correct answer -- but the green highlight is a useful indicator of quality content and a nice way for question askers to acknowledge when a particular answer really hits the mark!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I see that some replies to questions are marked in green as &#34;best answer&#34; but I can't see a way to do this myself for the questions I've posted. Have I overlooked something? I think the ability for questioners to &#34;close out&#34; a question (with or without a best answer) would be very useful. As it stands now, the ratio of open questions to closed questions is skewed heavily to towards the former, which I don't think properly reflects reality, and leaves a bad impression besides.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Another, unrelated suggestion is to offer shorter versions of the sticky &#34;So, what is this forum?&#34; post in several languages to encourage people to pose questions or to reply in French, Italian, German or what have you.. alternatively, simply encourage people to do it anyway in the existing Q&#38;amp;A. I suspect many in the DH community in Europe or Asia have no difficulty reading English but might feel hesitant to respond in writing in a non-native language.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I think you would probably want to use both TEI and KML. It's more appropriate to encode the text in TEI including the geospatial and other data, and the KML could be produced as a presentation format from the TEI source using an XSLT transform. Apart from KML, there is also the standard GML which is widely used in geospatial web services.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You should definitely take a look at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/hestia/findings/index.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/hestia/findings/index.html&#60;/a&#62; and in particular at this output: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/hestia/herodotus/basic.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/hestia/herodotus/basic.html&#60;/a&#62;

&#60;p&#62;kml would be a good alternative. It's xml, it's an open standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml&#60;/a&#62;) and it's quite flexible concerning spatiotemporal datasets (&#60;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/time.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/time.html&#60;/a&#62;)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi there,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Although I'm biased, I would suggest using the TEI guidelines for this. It has a fairly flexible vocabulary for recording place information (and people).  See for example &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDGEOG&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDGEOG&#60;/a&#62;  (though the whole chapter is relevant). It is fairly generalised and flexible which has its good points and bad points.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I want to create a set of maps to accompany an ancient Chinese historical text (ca. 100 BC). I want to be able to encode location (with some ambiguity), associated people and their movements, administration, and time. I know xml, so I'd much prefer to use an xml language. So I want to ask, what xml standards are available? And what are their advantages and disadvantages? I would also like to know about other historical mapping projects that use xml languages.&#60;br /&#62;
Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Scott

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In response to Sebastian, when I said that some people do not put non-ASCII characters into their XML, this was meant simply as an observation of the current state of affairs and is not a recommendation.  That is, I'm trying to explain why some people might say not to do this.  Naturally French speakers creating XML will use their keyboard layout to directly enter characters used in French and will have no trouble reading and proofreading these.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for use of tools, not everyone has full control over the environment in which everyone in their project operates.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd generally second what Sebastian says here. But, I'd also add a software-specific hint:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you happen to be using oXygen then you can do what are called 'code templates'.  This could consist of highly complex markup, or even just a single character.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So for example, although I can go to their character map and find a capital thorn character and click on it I find it easier to create a code template once with a capital thorn and name it THORN and thorn for the lowercase.  That means I can start writing 'thor' and hit control-space to see if there are any templates that this matches and select the one that comes up.  typing tho-ctrl-space-enter is certainly more keystrokes, but much easier than needing to remember unicode code points, and it puts an actual thorn character in there.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One could do the same with mdash or any manner of things.  I realise that is software-specific to a single editor, but any _good_ editor should allow you to do similar forms of abbreviation expansion or something. (So you can probably do something similar in whatever editor you are using.)&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;ach, I should have guessed that would happen. an editor which claimed to HTML but is a pale shadow. My code example should have been&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#38;lt;hi&#38;gt;t&#38;#234;te-&#38;#224;-t&#38;#234;te&#38;lt;/hi&#38;gt;
