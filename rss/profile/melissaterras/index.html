			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Ethan Gruber's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/collaborative-software-for-transcribing-digital-images-of-handwritten-documents#post-1994&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It's worth mentioning that Scripto itself is CMS-neutral (See &#60;a href='http://scripto.org/documentation/about/'&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;). Developers can build their own tools to make it talk with whatever CMS they want. So far, they've built the connectors for Omeka, WP, and Drupal, but more would be awesome.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not sure about Scripto to record TEI, though, since the transcriptions are recorded in MediaWiki.

&#60;p&#62;These are excellent questions, Ethan.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding image importing, at the moment the only transcription tools I know of supporting any sort of integration with external images are Scripto (Omeka, Wordpress, Drupal), FromThePage (Internet Archive), Islandora TEI Editor (Fedora), the (closed-source) BYU Historic Journals project (ContentDM), and Zooniverse Scribe (via deep-linking to any image on the internet, at a per-page level).  This is, in my opinion, a serious and non-trivial problem with all transcription tools -- just last week I talked with a librarian who really wanted to use T-PEN for medieval manuscript fragments, but was going to use Scripto instead, purely because the images were on their Omeka site.  It seems like rather than using the right tool for the job--and my own FromThePage would be just as inappropriate as Scripto for this use--she was using the tool which integrated with her CMS.  The problem is that it's a lot of effort to integrate tool X with CMS Y, and it's not a problem that scales well across either dimension.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not aware of any transcription tools that do linked data at all.  I know that I've looked into it for FromThePage, but those investigations remain just that -- exciting ideas which do not override improvements to the core tool.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding exports, the XML-(or TEI)-native T-PEN and Bentham Transcription Desk should support export of whatever TEI you use to put into them.  Ditto for MOM-CA-based tools like Itinera Nova, Monasterium, Virtuelles deutsches Urkundennetzwerk as well as the Papyrological Editor.  Mind you &#34;should&#34; is my own term -- I don't know if any of these tools actually feature an 'export' button or API.  FromThePage converts transcripts, subjects, indices, and edit histories into one big HTML file for export, with classes which may allow extraction and conversion.  (I explored TEI export in 2009, but at the time had no background in TEI and abandoned the project -- things will be different soon, however.)  I gather that Scripto exports to the CMS which is its database-of-record, and suspect that CrowdCrafting may well have an export feature as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I love your idea of combining annotation and open data -- it seems to come up all the time in conversation these days, but I don't know of any projects which have gotten beyond the idea stage.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sorry, to dredge up an old topic, but are any of the tools listed here capable of importing images from or otherwise interacting with DSpace? FromThePage appears to support some of the annotations that I would like to make about manuscript images, but I want to avoid making duplicates of images, if possible (since various derivatives will already be available in DSpace, should I elect to use it).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, is anyone aware of annotation tools that interact with web services, such as linking manuscripts to resources defined in VIAF or Geonames?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What sorts of export mechanisms are provided by these annotation tools?  Can I export to TEI?  MODS?  Something else?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I envision using an annotation tool in the back-end to generate TEI or some other robust form of metadata with links to thesauri like VIAF, Geonames, or the Pleiades Gazetteer of Ancient Places in order to import a lot of open data for enhanced context, generate maps, etc.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;although this post's already quite old, here's something I came across a while ago:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Perception of Space in Piero della Francesca's Annunciation: An Eye-Movement and Art-Historical Study&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Kapoula, Zo√Ø.; Bucci, Maria-Pia.; Yang, Qing.; Bacci, Francesca,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Leonardo, Volume 43, issue 2 (April 23, 2010), p. 153-158.&#60;br /&#62;
ISSN: 1530-9282&#60;br /&#62;
MIT Press&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Best,&#60;br /&#62;
Christian

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've used it with my iSchool students too. The thing we need right now, though, are sample TEI documents to download to test out some tools. Is it possible to have that on TEI by Example? Free, downloadable, collections of TEI texts that are valid? I will probably put up a question that asks the same . . .

&#60;p&#62;thanks Michelle, I think we're interested in finding that out. Sure, I can do a link analysis and find out who is linking back to us, but I was wondering how people are embedding it in their teaching. Interested to hear....

&#60;p&#62;This is exactly what I was hoping to get from this kind of discussion, thanks Mark. We are thinking &#34;what next&#34;, so I think you are on to something there. I cant promise it will happen anytime soon, but thanks, got me thinking...

			<description>&#60;p&#62;TEI by Example is a wonderful resource.  While I have never used it directly in a workshop on TEI, I invariably refer people to it, and have consulted it on occasion myself as needed.  So, well done!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On the principle that no good deed should go unpunished, however, it would be great to see it expanded a bit.  In particular, a section on transformations, or on using the TEI stylesheet templates, would be a terrific addition. This stage in the process of text encoding remains, I think, the greatest bottleneck to new users.  TEI XML is not particularly complicated and is easy to teach; XSLT, on the other hand, can be very difficult, and the TEI stylesheets are not presented in a particularly &#34;user-friendly&#34; way.  It would be enormously beneficial to TEI noobies to have a resource that answered the inevitable question:  &#34;Ok, I have a tagged text.  NOW what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In any case, as I say, well done!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Following on Bethany's post, I too plan to use the module on parallel segmentation to help me with a new project on the horizon, but I should also say that your post serves as a kick in the butt for me to update the training modules I have in place for my e-text interns.  Currently I use a crazy concoction of resources with a paired down version of Julia's and Syd's Intensive TEI Workshop as the focus (thank goodness for that) and have been meaning to transition to TEI by Example.  So, no real tales of use, just intended use, but I see great potential for TEI by Example as a training foundation for our interns and graduate assistants.  Once I get organized, at our shop, 5-10 interns/GAs a year will benefit from it.  I shall have more to say about it later, for sure.  Stay tuned.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Have others formally integrated TEI by Example in a course or as part of training workshops?  If so, are you willing to share syllabi or training documentation?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, Melissa -- I used it just last week and was very glad to have it! It's been a while since I've done any TEI markup, and I had never created a parallel segmented apparatus, so needed a refresher course. Along the way, I realized how useful it could be for my Rare Book School students, so will be recommending it. Thanks to all of you who contributed to such a fantastic resource! -- Bethany

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I used it on my own when I got started with TEI. I found it useful as an introduction to TEI, but never used it again since then.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I use it for demos of XML in introductory library-school classes, because students find it easier to assimilate than (say) a typical metadata schema. I'd like to go deeper, but at the moment I'm not teaching the right courses for that!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Folks&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd like to know a little more about how the DH community is using TEI by Example (&#60;a href=&#34;http://tbe.kantl.be/TBE/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://tbe.kantl.be/TBE/)&#60;/a&#62;. Have you used it as an individual, or in a class, or in a workshop, or That Camp? Could you sum up in a sentence or two how, where, and when you have found it useful?&#60;br /&#62;
best&#60;br /&#62;
Melissa
