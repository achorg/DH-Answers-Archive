			<description>&#60;p&#62;Bump. I notice now this: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalhumanities.ucla.edu/resources/us-dh-academic-programs.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.digitalhumanities.ucla.edu/resources/us-dh-academic-programs.html&#60;/a&#62; . Are there other such lists that have appeared in the interim?

&#60;p&#62;I hear you on this; and I don't think it has to be. It's as much teaching undergraduates* how to use the already effective tools that are out there -- how 18th century English Lit studies are changed by the accessibility of ECCO, EEBO, and the Burney Collection,** for example.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;*And even graduate students, staff, faculty, in some cases.&#60;br /&#62;
**Not that I'm blithely assuming that all colleges and unis have access to these tools.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I agree with you that interpretations of textual, visual, geographical, archaeological, etc. data within the humanities are digital humanities.  Almost everything I have done professionally or academically over the last six years has been DH, from GIS to 3D visualization to cultural heritage informatics.  I'm not going split hairs as to whether TEI and data mining are web-based or not, but I find myself increasingly frustrated by conversations about &#34;How do we teach/introduce students to DH,&#34; and all of the answers relate to some form of web development: designing a database schema, learning HTML/CSS.  These are things that are of limited usefulness in many humanities disciplines.  I understand that people will suggest skills based on their own experience, but DH is losing out a lot of experienced technologists and scholars from non-textual fields, and as I have observed DH becoming more and more narrowly focused, voices in the textual humanities fields have greater and greater influence (control, even) over what is or is not &#34;Digital Humanities.&#34;  That is why I suggest that people who call themselves digital humanists ought to reconsider their notion of DH.  I think the field is much bigger than they realize, and thus needs to be more inclusive.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Ethan Gruber's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-do-we-introduce-undergraduates-to-the-digital-humanities/page/2#post-1583&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have to say, I disagree with most, if not all, of this. There is plenty of coding work in DH that is not web-related. Text-mining and distant reading are examples, as is work encoding texts in TEI. I think I remember some very awesome visualizations of ancient architecture, too, that I would call non-web DH coding? :)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The thing that I disagree with most is the idea that we (counting myself as a digital humanist) need to rethink our notion of the Digital Humanities. Like the #transformDH hashtag, it is predicated on a set idea of DH that I do not think exists. It seems like less than a year ago that there was still very active discussion about the role of code in DH, what skills could/should be part of it, and how it all fits together. No one, I think, ever came up with a notion of DH that had widespread consensus as being a good definition. Now, it seems, we are chasing after responses to a non-existent notion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, I do see the existence of two branches of DH, with different histories. In broad strokes, one is the &#34;Humanities Computing&#34; branch, on is indeed the more web-oriented branch (which shares more in common with ed tech). This has been recounted many times before, sometimes in this very site.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd ask that we all recognize the youth of DH, and this it is -- whatever it is! -- still developing through informal channels like THATCamps and blogs and twitter conversation, and through the institutional decisions made by administrators and through cluster hires. In short, I think it is far too early to say that DH is far too focused on textual disciplines. It might be at present, but the ultimate constitution of DH is still very much to be determined. Awesome visualization and interpretation of data -- textual, architectual, visual, geographical, temporal, archaeological, and more -- through digital/code-based means can and should be part of DH. I consider it to be implicit that it _is_, but maybe hasn't had as much attention as other aspects. Seems parallel to the Theory and DH questions that way?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Is learning to code even important in Digital Humanities?  I argue that it's not.  There are particular technologies that are relevant to various disciplines in the humanities, and web development isn't necessarily one of them (since coding always refers to web development in DH contexts).  Digital Humanities, capital D capital H, is far too focused on the textual disciplines and hardly inclusive of the humanities as a whole.  Digital Humanists ought to reconsider their notion of the Digital Humanities.  If you wonder why computer scientists are reluctant to get involved in Capital D Capital H, it's for this reason.  There are actually a great many computer scientists involved elsewhere in the humanities.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for all the great answers!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To update this forum, two of the respondents (Brian Croxall and Jeff McClurken) along with Ryan Cordell spoke about &#34;Teaching DH 101: Introduction to the Digital Humanities&#34; for NITLE's Digital Scholarship Seminars in December.  You can access the recording from the event website:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This seminar prompted a couple of posts on the NITLE blog because the presenters didn't really address coding for undergrads.  Here are a couple of posts that adress that issue:&#60;br /&#62;
Can Humanities Undergrads Learn to Code? by undergrads who learned to code in a humanities course at Pitt &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#60;/a&#62; (The answer is yes!!)&#60;br /&#62;
More Coding for Humanities Undergrads by Kathryn Tomasek, Wheaton College (again yes!!) &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#60;/a&#62;

&#60;p&#62;You are right, it is a difficult search. I may have, perhaps, misstated the object of my search. I am in fact looking for a graduate programme of any kind that deals with digital culture/art/literature from a theoretical perspective. I have an undergraduate degree and I thought it would make sense to aim for graduate programmes. It is my understanding that I can apply for either master's programmes or doctoral programmes, but I assumed that it would be easier to be admitted to a master's. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I also need funding in order to study abroad, in any form, whether it be a scholarship or tuition waiver or some scheme in which I can work or do research in order to support myself.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Perhaps I should have made  myself clearer from the beginning. The sort of research I aim to do is best described in this (soon to be published) text: &#60;a href=&#34;http://mariuslobontiu.ro/2010/09/playing-the-text-a-call-for-theory-in-digital-fiction/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mariuslobontiu.ro/2010/09/playing-the-text-a-call-for-theory-in-digital-fiction/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much for your help.

&#60;p&#62;It is in fact a lifelong dream of mine to study in London. I just assumed that funding options were far more limited than in the US, so I thought it would be more realistic to just apply there. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I see that the programme you suggest has quite a comprehensive list of scolarships and international student funding, so I will definitely apply (in spite of the fact that it is not 100% what I was looking for - but it is close enough). I will also start looking for other post-graduate programmes in or around London that deal with digital culture/literature/art. Thank you very much for your suggestion!

&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much for your suggestions. I am indeed more interested in studying digital art and fiction. I have been trying the exact approach you mention for quite some time (googling DH and its synonyms) but I haven't found as many programmes as I had hoped. That's why I turned to this forum (and I'm very glad I did!).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far I've been taking the centres listed here ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/&#60;/a&#62; ) one by one, hoping to find a post-graduate programme associated with them. It's going slow and I'm not sure if this is the right list to start from. Is there any other list that you might know of, that would be helpful?

Perhaps I should have made  myself clearer from the beginning. The sort of research I aim to do is best described in this (soon to be published) text: &#60;a href=&#34;http://mariuslobontiu.ro/2010/09/playing-the-text-a-call-for-theory-in-digital-fiction/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mariuslobontiu.ro/2010/09/playing-the-text-a-call-for-theory-in-digital-fiction/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
Thank you very much for your help.&#60;/p&#62;

&#60;p&#62;From my discussions with the co-director of the program, it is my understanding that LUC's program is terminal based. The intention is to prepare students to work in careers in DH. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That being said, my interest in the program is as a gateway to my PhD in English. My interests are in textual studies, more specifically serial publications in Victorian England. A program such as this gives options either furthering education afterward or getting right into the field.
