			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks Amanda and Jennifer - I've updated the Zotero collection. I've remembered that this topic is (very) closely related to the broader issue of evaluation and review, so people stumbling across this question might also like to have a look at content in &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/WU6FDQC7&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/WU6FDQC7&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/&#60;/a&#62; (Vol. 1, No.4, 2012).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you haven't done so already, you might consider the resources available from Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, &#34; an international organization dedicated to promoting the adoption, creation, use, dissemination, and preservation of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs)&#34;.  Their website is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ndltd.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.ndltd.org/&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And Liza Potts from Michigan State University and Kathie Gossett from Iowa State University received a 2012 Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for &#34;Building an Open-Source Archive for Born-Digital Dissertations.&#34; They hosted a &#34;three-day workshop to explore relevant issues and identify requirements for the development of an archive for the preservation of dissertations that incorporate interactive or dynamic digital media.&#34;  Their entry in the NEH database is &#60;a href=&#34;https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&#38;amp;gn=HD-51561-12&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&#38;amp;gn=HD-51561-12&#60;/a&#62; and the video of their lightning round talk at the NEH project directors meeting where they describe their project is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahuULHlcsoU#t=9m27s&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahuULHlcsoU#t=9m27s&#60;/a&#62; .  Eventually, they will post a white paper evaluating their project activities.  In the meantime, I'm sure that either of these two scholars would be happy to discuss their project with you.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for starting this collection, James! The following aren't specific dissertations, but some resources both discussing new models for dissertations as well as mentioning specific digital dissertation projects:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;#digdiss and #SCIGradEd (Scholarly Communication Institute's “Rethinking Humanities Graduate Education” work)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;#SCIGradEd released a report and additional resources, many of which touch on the dissertation: &#60;a href=&#34;http://uvasci.org/current-work/graduate-education/rethinking-grad-ed-oct-2012/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://uvasci.org/current-work/graduate-education/rethinking-grad-ed-oct-2012/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I did a Storify about non-book-length/digital dissertations here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/21/dh-the-dissertation-literature-style/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/21/dh-the-dissertation-literature-style/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've started a Zotero collection here &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/KAIJQCCV&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/KAIJQCCV&#60;/a&#62; with a few items, but am generally just keen to hear about any policies, processes or successfully completed digital dissertations / theses. This could include humanities dissertations presented as websites, multi-media products etc. It might also include hybrid models, where the candidate presents both a traditional print output and associated digital ones.

&#60;p&#62;Junior Fellows Summer Intern Program Mission&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Library of Congress Junior Fellows Summer Intern program (10 weeks) offers undergraduate and graduate students insights into the environment, culture and collections of the world's largest and most comprehensive repository of human knowledge. Through the Junior Fellows program, the Library of Congress furthers its mission to provide access to a universal record of human knowledge and creativity as exemplified by its collections, while supporting current and future generations of students and scholars. The interns explore digital initiatives and inventory, catalog, arrange, preserve and research a backlog of copyright or special collections materials in many different formats in various divisions.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is a good question.. I can't now recall seeing postings for DH internships before on the usual lists like Humanist-L (though a search through their archive shows that there were some posted now and again &#60;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/xteGeX)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://bit.ly/xteGeX)&#60;/a&#62;. Then again, when someone did contact me about a possible DH internship (it only happened once) during my tenure at Humanities Computing in Chicago I was pleasantly surprised and very happy to make something happen for that student. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My advice is to contact institutions directly with a set of possible areas of interest. To get started you could trawl the list of past NEH Office of Digital Humanities (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.neh.gov/ODH/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.neh.gov/ODH/&#60;/a&#62;) grant awardees for the DC area. If it's a short-term internship (say, for the summer) they may well be able to find funding for it somewhere at short notice. The other approach may be to join the Humanist list (&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/&#60;/a&#62;) and then post your request there.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

According to the site, the announcement about the 2012 application cycle should be announced soon.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What are your academic interests?  Digital humanities is a large grab bag; it would help to know what sorts of tasks you would like to learn or do.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='/profile/kintopp'&#62;kintopp&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-practices-and-models-for-digital-scholary-collections#post-1297&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For what it's worth, the Machyn project (which I orchestrated) has a &#34;bookbag&#34; feature, but it doesn't actually save search results.  It saves brief citations to particular bibliographic items in the digital collection, but the Machyn collection only has two items, so it's not really useful.  However, the search interface remembers your search history for that browser session, so you can, in fact, look back at your recent searches.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking forward to your experiences in Haiti. Although, I've shared some of this information with you in private, I thought I would post some of these resources for the larger DH community (never too early to start preparing them for &#60;a href=&#34;http://caribbean2012.thatcamp.org/&#34;&#62;THATCampCaribe&#60;/a&#62;!):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Caribbean Association of Libraries, ACURIL is an invaluable resource for connections in the area: &#60;a href=&#34;http://acuril.uprrp.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://acuril.uprrp.edu/&#60;/a&#62; They are doing an excellent job, and they acknowledge the role of new technologies in the future of Caribbean archival and scholarly communications work.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To get an overview of the present state of libraries across the Caribbean region, a good book to read is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Caribbean-Libraries-Century-Changes-Challenges/dp/1573873012&#34;&#62;Caribbean Libraries in the 21st Century&#60;/a&#62;. The book covers mostly the English-speaking Caribbean, but most of the issues are relevant to the other linguistic areas.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For Haiti in particular, an invaluable source of information and networking is the Haitian Studies Association: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.haitianstudies.umb.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.haitianstudies.umb.edu/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As Jen Serventi pointed out, Brown U. is a key player here. They happen to have the largest collection of Haiti materials outside of Haiti. The contact there is &#60;a href=&#34;http://library.brown.edu/sr/profile.php?id=30&#34;&#62;Dominique Coulombe&#60;/a&#62;. I had the pleasure of meeting with her recently, and she is eager to work with that collection. Let me know if you're interested. The Department of Africana Studies there is also looking to make things happen.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Immediately following the earthquake, the John Carter Brown Library put together a digital project called Remember Haiti.  Here's the website &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/remember_haiti/index.php&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/remember_haiti/index.php&#60;/a&#62;.  In the About this Site section, I see that they list all of their partners.
