			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks Stéfan. Curiously, I haven't seen your answer before. There is a French app, called Tropes, unfortunately not open source, that can be used (an English version exists). But it is very limited. I'll look at StanfordNLP or NLTK if I can do something with it.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I checked some of the bigger APIs (OpenCalais, AlchemyAPI) and they don't seem overly interested in flexible parsing of dates. If a bit of coding is possible, you might have more luck with GATE or StanfordNLP, and in particular the SUTime module that can be tested here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sutime/process&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sutime/process&#60;/a&#62; (the bad news is that I suspect this language model is limited to English). There's probably an Python NLTK module as well, but nothing I could find after a quick search was particularly well-suited for detecting &#34;traces of time&#34;. Please do let us know if you find something! I could maybe be bribed to look at adding this to Voyant ;)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear all,&#60;br /&#62;
I have a database with more than one million tweets (about WW1). What I'd like to do now is to recognize dates and traces of time.&#60;br /&#62;
Has anyone an idea of how to do this? (In French and English).&#60;br /&#62;
Best

&#60;p&#62;+1 to Vagrant. Vagrant's portability also means that if lab users get to a good point with a Vagrant instance on a lab machine, they should be more or less able to take a copy of the Vagrant instance with them.

&#60;p&#62;An update to #1 on my list: MAMP Pro 3 (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/&#60;/a&#62;) now lets you spin up a number of CMS sites (most importantly, Wordpress and Drupal) with a few clicks. Another option is to set up Vagrant (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.vagrantup.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.vagrantup.com/&#60;/a&#62;) to quickly and easily set up dev environments (including CMSs) that don't affect the host computer and can be ported to a live site easily (because Vagrant uses virtual machines, it's easier to make your dev and live environments exactly the same as to all those finicky server details like what version of PHP you're running, than it is with MAMP). Vagrant's site has user-friendly documentation, and it would be pretty easy for someone to create a several-step &#34;here's how to create your own Drupal or WP site on this lab machine&#34; flyer.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Cécile Armand has written an analysis (in French) of different online timeline tools.&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://advertisinghistory.hypotheses.org/79&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://advertisinghistory.hypotheses.org/79&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
I have used SIMILE. Dates came from an XML file and could be year only. But the position on the timeline was not where I would have liked. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Has anyone dealt with a large number of events (over 1,000) ? Is there a way to provide &#34;levels of detail&#34; so that the user is not submerged with an overloaded timeline?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for any suggestions on this.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Just a second vote for Timeline.js, though my main beef is the requirement to have data either hosted externally or in JSON format, a bit of a hurdle for many n00bs. I'm very interested to hear more about your work, @&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/milner_matt'&#62;milner_matt&#60;/a&#62;, with hooking it up (de facto) to a MySQL db. Are you working on a fork or just on your own? (I couldn't find you in GitHub.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For what it's worth, I'm maintaining my running list of timeline tools at &#60;a href=&#34;http://delicious.com/triplingual/timeline+chronology&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://delicious.com/triplingual/timeline+chronology&#60;/a&#62;, including a link to @croxall's Google Spreadsheet from a while back.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Oddly enough I'm actually building a timeline tool for the Intro to European History I'm teaching this fall. Basically I'm going to crowdsource a European timeline between 400AD-1700AD in the classroom.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've looked a few things - yes, SIMILE is great and the de facto standard. But as an historian the date handling rubs me the wrong way - perhaps I'm reading the code wrong, but it requires a valid JS Date to work. I want more ambiguity and flexibility when it comes to date parts. I also wanted to place the entire timeline within a custom-designed course website rather than try and handle it with moodle, wordpress, drupal, etc. or even WebCT/Blackboard like 'things' (don't know what else to call them). SIMILE is ideal for most of this. That said, I decided to try something else.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's a link of some useful jQuery based timelines I looked at: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2013/06/jquery-timeline-plugins.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2013/06/jquery-timeline-plugins.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
I wanted something simple that could handle quite a bit of student-produced data. Timeliner.js at TechnoTarek looked about right, but I was really going for something horizontal and with a nice nav bar like SIMILE - so I went with VeriteCo's TimelineJS &#60;a href=&#34;http://timeline.verite.co/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://timeline.verite.co/)&#60;/a&#62;. It can handle BC dates as well as AD dates.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are several advantages with this - first is being able to embed a timeline right away using their site and a published googlespreadsheet. The other is the code is pretty straightforward. I'm in the process of adapting it to run off of ajax-generated&#60;br /&#62;
JSON from a MYSQL DB. The only thing is the viewable space for each item - though there's media handling (not using it for other reasons in my course), there's not enough place for a description of the event itself. So I'm using a dialog box to display the full contents, while the timeline itself has a teaser.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The big disadvantage is that TimelineJS uses LazyLoad to create the 'story' - meaning that I'm stuck at the moment with an awkward setTimeout after the ajax / rendering to make further jQuery-based selections. $.ajaxStop() doesn't work because of the small (but significant) space in between the completion of the ajax request and the rendering from JSON into html elements. If anyone has suggestions on how to add a callback (was thinking .always or someting .done / .when-.then - but these are all ajax, and I don't have time to crack the minified js and insert a callback variable...) - without too much trouble, please let me know.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've integrated Timemap (&#60;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/timemap/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://code.google.com/p/timemap/&#60;/a&#62;) into a lot of different projects.  Timemap is a JS library that binds mapping libraries (e.g., OpenLayers or Google Maps) together with Simile timeline.  Simile still seems to be the de facto standard timeline library in DH.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Time for the annual/biannual timeline tools question: any recommendations for timeline tools? Of the many that are out there, including those that have been recommended here before, any movement to coalesce around a stellar handful?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some useful features would be: free online (no need to install on lab computers, or quick easy to install), includes multiple file types, might be three dimensional (or at least a &#34;matrix&#34; type design), can deal with 'circa' type dates.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks, Hope.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @dot.porter's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/virtual-lightbox-or-what-are-some-good-image-comparison-tools#post-2004&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you don't have a lot of support for code modding, should I presume you don't have much infrastructural support as well? This stuff necessitates installing FastCGI on a server, as well as IIPImage Server (&#60;a href=&#34;http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/)&#60;/a&#62;. It can be installed whole hog on a recent-version Ubuntu server relatively easily, but that last phrase's meaning may vary greatly.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If your holdup is in code modding and not infrastructure, I might be able to help with some light modding, as I've done some for my own needs already. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(Belated note that I corresponded about this way back with Joe Padfield at the National Gallery, and he was wonderful to work with.)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for something simple. The VL is set up to automatically load with specified images already there, then you can move them around, zoom in and out, nice for basic comparison. I don't have much support for code modification right now. I'll check out IIPImage!

&#60;p&#62;What sort of comparisons are you looking to do? And who do you have available for what level of creation or adaptation?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've had some luck with using adaptations of the National Gallery (UK) adaptations of IIPImage, such as &#60;a href=&#34;http://cima.ng-london.org.uk/iip/examples/newcomp.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://cima.ng-london.org.uk/iip/examples/newcomp.html&#60;/a&#62;.
