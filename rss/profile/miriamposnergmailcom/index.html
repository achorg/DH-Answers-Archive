			<description>&#60;p&#62;Just a couple of newer ones to add to your list: alongside the &#34;Original Sources&#34; Mellon program you mention above, CLIR and the Library of Congress are offering a &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.clir.org/fellowships/mellon/preservation.html&#34;&#62;fellowship placement&#60;/a&#62; in the Library's Preservation Research &#38;amp; Testing Division, for PhD students whose work would benefit from techniques like hyperspectral imaging, x-ray fluorescence, spectroscopy, high-resolution microscopy, etc. -- and METRO has announced a &#60;a href=&#34;http://fellowship.metro.org/?q=node/4&#34;&#62;new program&#60;/a&#62; that will match fellows with projects in its network of New York-based libraries. This program isn't specifically designed for PhD students, as I understand it, but open to them.

&#60;p&#62;Oxford Texts Archive is full of amazing things (including EEBO-TCP texts), though students might have to register for access: &#60;a href=&#34;http://ota.ox.ac.uk/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://ota.ox.ac.uk/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This huge list of museums/libraries etc data compiled by Mia Ridge emphasises APIs and linked open data but it's actually very wide-ranging: &#60;a href=&#34;http://museum-api.pbworks.com/w/page/21933420/Museum%C2%A0APIs&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://museum-api.pbworks.com/w/page/21933420/Museum%C2%A0APIs&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;br /&#62;
I'm putting together assignments for next semester's digital history class, and want to construct a simple distant reading for my students, probably using Voyant Tools (unless there is a very easy-to-use pure HTML/Javascript set of tools that will let my students use some of the basic JS skills they'll have acquired in their previous assignment).  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would like to present them with existing corpora of historical texts: preferably not literature, but newspapers/government documents, letters etc. Most archives I've found use PDF images with mediocre to poor OCR.  Can anyone point me to a good collection of historical corpora that students can experiment with?  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Update: People on Twitter suggested a lot of university-specific grad fellowships (at &#60;a href=&#34;http://humanities.lib.rochester.edu/mellondh/&#34;&#62;the University of Rochester&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://mith.umd.edu/community/fellowships/winnemore-fellows/&#34;&#62;the University of Maryland&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;https://simpsoncenter.org/programs/initiatives/digital-humanities/digital-humanities-commons&#34;&#62;the University of Washington&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://scholarslab.org/uncategorized/call-for-applications-graduate-fellowship-in-the-digital-humanities/&#34;&#62;the University of Virginia&#60;/a&#62;,and Carnegie Mellon).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The &#60;a href=&#34;http://editingmodernism.ca/funding/phd-stipends/&#34;&#62;Editing Modernism in Canada fellowship&#60;/a&#62; is open to grad students at &#60;a href=&#34;http://editingmodernism.ca/about-us/partners/&#34;&#62;EMIC partner universities&#60;/a&#62;. The University of Pennsylvania's Schoenberg Research Center's &#60;a href=&#34;http://schoenberginstitute.org/graduate-student-research-fellowship/&#34;&#62;Graduate Student Fellowship&#60;/a&#62; encourages digital projects.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Alex Gil et al.'s &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/achorg/dhfunding/blob/gh-pages/index.md&#34;&#62;list of DH funding opportunities&#60;/a&#62; might be useful.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I feel like this question gets asked periodically in various fora, but perhaps there are new developments I'm not aware of:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Are there any options out there for graduate students looking for fellowships to do specifically DH work? ACH micro-grants and the like are helpful, of course, but I'm thinking of fellowships along the lines of the &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.acls.org/programs/dcf/&#34;&#62;Mellon dissertation completion fellowship&#60;/a&#62; or the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.clir.org/fellowships/mellon&#34;&#62;CLIR Original Sources&#60;/a&#62; fellowships. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm asking specifically for American grad students, but I'm sure future readers will appreciate links to other fellowships as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Returning to this since there are now a lot (and when I say &#34;a lot&#34;... &#60;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software)&#60;/a&#62; of web-based options for project management out there.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've started testing Active Collab (&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.activecollab.com/features.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.activecollab.com/features.html&#60;/a&#62;) and would be grateful for feedback from anyone else who has used this. I'd also love to hear about first hand experience with other alternatives now that 4 years have passed since the question was first posted.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You might like to take a look at Heurist - &#60;a href=&#34;http://HeuristNetwork.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://HeuristNetwork.org&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It might not at first appear to be what you are looking for - it's a generic database for Humanities data - but it is easily configured to handle image metadata, including DC, so out-of-the-box might be a day to get set up. It handles remotely stored images eg. in Picasa, as well as indexing images in situ. It has good querying, including facetted queries in version 4 (to be released this month). Out-of-the box it gives you mapping and timelines, as well as connections between entities (which can include images, creators, owner, collections, auctions etc). It's currently handling in the 25,000 image range for a first world war project and a study on Balinese artists, including a mixture of jpg, tif and PDF.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm happy to assist with setting up an out-of-the-box image database - it's something I need to do for another project - and once that's done it really will be a 5 minute job to build a new image database. Email me on: &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:ian.johnson@sydney.edu.au&#34;&#62;ian.johnson@sydney.edu.au&#60;/a&#62; (in western Europe time zone until late June).

&#60;p&#62;I like the &#34;back in the day&#34; phrase - I remember these conferences at ALLC/ACH conferences in the mid-90s. The proffered solutions cost thousands of dollars. You'd think by now...*sigh*

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I, too, have been looking for a solution but perhaps should define what I mean by solution before assuming this is what everyone wants. I want:&#60;br /&#62;
- to handle a collection of hundreds of images.&#60;br /&#62;
- ability to browse through them quickly (by image, not just by name--rather like you can do in a &#34;Cover Flow&#34; view in a Finder window on a Mac) because sometimes it's easier to see the one you want rather than try to remember what text strings are associated with it to search on.&#60;br /&#62;
- ability to assign standard metadata (probably Dublin Core) as well as tags, then sort on those. Faceted sorting/browsing would be nice too.&#60;br /&#62;
- ability to sort based on any metadata or tag field and deliver the browse view described above. (This is where things break down.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, I've used dSpace - tedious metadata entry (when is that not the case?) but easy searching and the resulting view is reasonably browse-able. I've used Omeka: ditto on the metadata, not so great on the searching/browsing unless you can customize your own Collection display view. I've used iPhoto but as soon as you try to port the images somewhere else there always seem to be problems, not to mention the metadata is...metadata? what metadata? And other things that were even worse.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Back in the day, some of our Art History faculty in Chicago swore by Extensis Portfolio (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.extensis.com/digital-asset-management/portfolio/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.extensis.com/digital-asset-management/portfolio/)&#60;/a&#62;. Another possibility for desktop tools might be Canto Cumulus (though it may not pass your &#34;out of the box&#34; test).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm sure if you (or someone who is a member) posted this to a forum used by the Visual Resources Association community (&#38;lt;VRA-L@LISTSERV.UARK.EDU&#38;gt;) you'd get additional and fuller answers. Also (just guessing though) you might even be able to find some discussion of this in the abstracts for their annual conference.
