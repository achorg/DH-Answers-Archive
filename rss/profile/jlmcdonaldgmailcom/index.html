			<description>&#60;p&#62;With such a large storage need, you will likely find (as many others have pointed out) that it's not cost effective to couple your storage with your hosting (since hosts, just like cellphone manufacturers, always WAY overcharge for storage space). So one possible alternative would be to split up the hosting and the storage. You can get up to 1TB of Amazon S3 storage for a penny a GB, meaning you'd only be paying 57 cents a month with your needs ... then integrate that with the $5/month plan at Digital Ocean (where you don't end up paying for all the features you'll never use on a shared host ... they just spin up a virtual server for you to do with as you please), pay $12 / year for the domain name through a registrar-only service, and you've hit your price point.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've used &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.justhost.com/hosting-features&#34;&#62;JustHost&#60;/a&#62; for several years and have been happy with their service and customer service. There is a limit on the number of files you can store, so you wouldn't want to keep a large archive of images there. (Check other services for similar restrictions.) That's OK if you've got another place to store the files and if you can handle any &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing&#34;&#62;CORS&#60;/a&#62; issues that may arise from having them on a separate domain.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm using Reclaim Hosting for a lot of faculty projects, but I've also used Bluehost for years. Technically, at least, they have unlimited storage, subdomains, databases, etc., but I've had really big Drupal sites (with 100k+ pieces of content) go over their limit of 2GB/database. You can also only run maybe 5-6 Drupal sites before you go over their max allowed # of database tables per account.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I find Reclaim Hosting quite good and they're Omeka's top suggestion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Shared hosting is really cheap, but there is a 10gb limit. For your 57gb + of images the only clear option they offer is $40 per month. Worth keeping in mind for comparison purposes if nothing else: &#60;a href=&#34;https://reclaimhosting.com/pricing/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://reclaimhosting.com/pricing/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've always used University resources for web hosting (web site, Wordpress blog, Omeka, dSpace, etc.) but now I have some personal research to post so I would like to start building my own space outside the University. So, here is the usual,frequently asked, difficultly broad question: can anyone recommend a web hosting service? I see BlueHost, DreamHost and HostGator talked about but would like pros and cons of those and others. Any new hosts making a splash? Any you have dealt with in the past that were disappointing?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My requirements are decent service, cheap (under $10/month if possible), domain name, lots of space (currently have about 3,000 images using 57 GB of space. About half of that is in tifs that I can store elsewhere but this will continue to be a growing image database), and I'll want to install the programs listed above along with whatever may come along. I've installed and run MAMP locally but, as I said, this will be the first time doing this out in the big world so I'm not even sure which questions to ask about what to look for.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Seems to me Google Glass Apps will build upon the &#34;Augmented Reality&#34; tools that people have been tinkering with on smart phones for a few years now.  This is often used to augment trips to cities or museums.  Here's an iPhone app for historical Edinburgh and a list to virtual cities projects collected by a UNC class.&#60;br /&#62;
I'm going to a wedding in Scotland this month, will have to try it out and report!&#60;br /&#62;

&#34;A JISC funded iPhone App that lets visitors to Edinburgh walk over historical maps. The maps are provided by Landmark Information Group and the National Library of Scotland. The software was developed by Edinburgh College of Art, University of Edinburgh. Historical tours were provided with the kind assistance of Edinburgh World Heritage and Margaret Stewart.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Virtual Cities projects - &#60;a href=&#34;http://virtualcities.web.unc.edu/projects/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://virtualcities.web.unc.edu/projects/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
&#34;The following list is a working list of “Virtual Cities” projects. This projects and sites on this list range from extensive academic and library projects to one-off journalistic data visualization. The list is long but far from exhaustive–so please feel free to comment with additional sites!&#34;

&#60;p&#62;Thanks this is what I was looking for. I am curious now about what they mention about forming an s-corporation, etc. I'll start a new question for that.

&#60;p&#62;While not designed for contributors to DH projects in particular, you might look at the agreements in &#34;section B&#34; of &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.publishing.umich.edu/Publishing_Agreements&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://wiki.publishing.umich.edu/Publishing_Agreements&#60;/a&#62; .  In these agreements, the author of a work grants rights to a party responsible for the journal or book series.  These rights include allowing their work to be published under a CC license.

&#60;p&#62;Thanks, that was also my understanding, but it is interesting that the TEI consortium is using both at the link above. Of course they are doing so for ODD files and other objects that are part code/part data.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Stéfan Sinclair's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/licenses-and-ip-agreements-for-dh-projects#post-1956&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd like to bump my question: Would anyone want to share agreement form that they use for contributors? I am imagining a document in which a contributor could license or otherwise give the rights to the data they are contributing to a project (yes, they could also put the CC license directly into the data, but it would also be useful to have some sort of user agreement that users could sign acknowledging the use of the open licenses).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;CC licenses are general purpose content licenses, and shouldn't be used for software licensing (in fact, Creative Commons themselves are the ones that state as much: &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software)&#60;/a&#62;. Likewise, it wouldn't make sense to use a license designed for software for your non-code content. Given this, I've generally used a CC-BY license for the content and an MIT license for the code (though some recent projects I've been involved with have chosen to go with the Mozilla license for the code rather than MIT).

			<guid isPermaLink="false">1967@http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/</guid>
			<description>&#60;p&#62;Any more answers on this question?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Specifically, I am curious about the following. If I were to follow the TEI consortium practice, can I license both content and code simultaneousely under CC-BY and BSD-2 or -3 Clause? (Can I license content that is just plain text under BSD-2 or 3?).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Secondly, I am curious could anyone share contributor forms that you ask contributors to sign authorizing these licenses?
