			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thank you so much, Patrick. The advice is appreciated. I've managed to download several years of the text, but the OCR is pretty terrible. Also, I've read a bit about topic modeling, but I'll look into it a bit more.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Goals and scope for the project might depend on the difficulty of the part of the project that's implicit in all your questions -- getting OCR'd text or some other electronic form out of the articles. A quick look at their site makes it look expensive, and some publishers get squeemish, at least, about this kind of project.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Depending on how you can get reasonably in machine-readable form, you might have to limit the scope to only one issue a year, or to a smaller date range, or both. That might make the 4th question a bit more feasible than the others.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On the other hand, if you can get everything, the 1st question sounds like a good topic modeling project.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Getting cited texts sounds pretty hard, or at least labor intensive. It would be difficult to parse out citations from the plain text. However, if you can't get plain text and only have images to work from, then that sounds like the most feasible question to pursue after you do that labor intensive work of collecting the data.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm interested in learning more about computer-based textual analysis, so I developed a project using the journal Literature/Film Quarterly (LFQ). I haven't done this sort of research before, so I'm trying to determine the best questions to ask and the tools that will help me answer them. I'm hoping someone might be able to tell me if these are reasonable questions to ask. I'd also appreciate any suggestions. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;LFQ began in 1973 and continues now. As the oldest journal in the field, looking at the text should be able to provide some insights about how adaptation studies developed.  At about 50 articles a year for 43 years, I'm looking at 2150 articles.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Questions: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Can an examination of the entire text of LFQ reveal anything substantial about the way adaptation studies has changed from 1973-present?&#60;br /&#62;
What are the most frequently cited texts in each year? WebofScience doesn't support this journal.&#60;br /&#62;
What names (other scholars) appear most frequently each year?&#60;br /&#62;
What kinds of terms are used in earlier years (e.g. “fidelity,” &#34;intertextuality&#34;) and do they continue throughout the journal’s history?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If there are other questions that I could explore, I'd appreciate any suggestions.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-did-you-learn-to-code#post-2378</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been unsure how to respond to this question, because it's so big and complicated.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;All the tools and resources mentioned are right on, and you'll discover how useful they are for your specific purposes as you go along.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;But, at the risk of bouncing off my personal experience, that doesn't say much about how I &#60;em&#62;learned&#60;/em&#62; to code. I worked from a pile of O'Reilly books, and wish that I had all of the resources that are now available online. That's not &#60;em&#62;how&#60;/em&#62; I learned, though. Those are tools to help give info and examples.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So. How did I learn to code?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;First. Get to know how you learn. (skipping the 'to code' part)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Do you learn from following examples? Or do you learn from studying the abstract principles, and learning how to apply them? Or something else? The point is that the basic 'how do I learn' seems most important.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Okay, then, 'how do I learn to code' (which seems like the question underlying what you stated)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm a big fan of instant gratification. However you go at it, trying something that'll produce quick results that you can see and be proud of is great fun. It's not like an article for a journal where you wait ages for feedback. You can produce your own feedback by trying something and seeing immediately what the result is. Even if it doesn't seem directly related to upcoming project(s), that's a great way to learn. The more you do it, the more you'll be able to tackle bigger things, with more deferred payoff. It's like going through the training rounds in a game.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Be comfortable not knowing things. Then experiment to taste to learn them.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Maybe even take a cue from the creative writers, and seek out/form a coding group, just like writers get into writing groups. That's not something I did, but some experiences were close, and DH is ready to have those. Forums or dev lists for software or projects are a good approximation.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;When in doubt, try it out!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;br /&#62;
I started my PhD last year and have been learning to code for it. My research is using R and I've taken a couple of online courses, I also found Matthew Jockers' book Text Analysis With R for Students of Literature helpful. There is a great online community for R with tutorials and how to videos, and Stack Exchage has been great for specific problems.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With TEI practice is key, working or volunteering on a project which uses TEI really helps. I've helped on the Letters of 1916 project which uses TEI encoding. Anyone can log in and transcribe letters, the transcription desk uses a small number of tags which helps you become familiar with a few before moving onto more complex examples.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Wow, thank you all for the wonderful advice and resources. I am in a DH course at LSU right now, and I shared your responses with my classmates, who were also very happy for the practical tips. I have a network visualization project in mind, and I found beginning lessons on Programming Historian, so I might start there. If you are interested in what we're up to at LSU, we have a class website at &#60;a href=&#34;http://engl7121s16.laurenacoats.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://engl7121s16.laurenacoats.org/&#60;/a&#62;, which includes our syllabus and weekly posts about our digital explorations. Thanks again!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Amanda Visconti's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-did-you-learn-to-code#post-2372&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As an add-on to Scott's #1: the Firebug extension (available for Firefox, can't remember if there's a Chrome version currently) is both a great way to learn about website HTML and CSS, and a fantastic tool to use everyday as a web designer. It lets you click on specific pieces of a webpage to see how they're coded, and it also lets you temporarily make changes to the webpage by playing with the existing HTML and CSS (e.g. you can visit the New York Times' webpage and alter its font type or color, change how articles are spaced, etc.). Sometimes taking an existing site and trying to alter it a bit is a good way of learning how it was built.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/leahpowell'&#62;LeahPowell&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-did-you-learn-to-code#post-2368&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hi, Leah! You might be interested in reading this collection of &#34;how I got started&#34; stories from the participants at a recent symposium on DH development (the NEH-funded UVa Scholars' Lab's Speaking in Code): &#60;a href=&#34;http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/starting/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/starting/&#60;/a&#62; Some of these are more origin stories than steps to get started, but some might have some information that's useful (especially since the conference was focused on making tacit DH development knowledge more public).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There's also a Digital Humanities Slack (an online chat forum with specific rooms for chatting about DH questions, coding, teaching DH, etc.) you're very welcome to join via &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.TinyUrl.com/DHSlack&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.TinyUrl.com/DHSlack&#60;/a&#62;. It's a good place to ask questions if any come up as you're coding—or if you want recommendations for tools to build on or programming languages to use.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Here are a couple of tips:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1. Begin by learning html and css to code your own website (there are plenty of online tutorials, including codeacademy.com). After you get the basics, decide what else you would like to do and then Google &#34;How do I do _________ in html/css&#34;? (You fill in the blank.) You'll find plenty of answers online. Get used to this Google procedure; it's the best way to learn. Look especially for answers on stackoverflow.com.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2. TEI is overwhelming, and most projects only use a tiny bit of the schema. So it is best to have a specific project which requires only a few elements that are easy to understand. Eventually, you'll come across a situation that is not so clear, and for this you'll have to start reading the TEI guidelines. One helpful tip I've found is to go to a definition of an element like &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-unclear.html&#34;&#62;unclear&#60;/a&#62; in the index, scroll to the bottom to see an example, and then back to the top to click on the links to the chapter discussion. That's how I've gradually become much more familiar with how to apply the TEI Guidelines.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Both of the above examples involve descriptive coding. If you want to learn programming, I suggest starting with Python, in part because I second The Programming Historian as a source of good tutorials. DARIAH-DE's &#60;a href=&#34;https://de.dariah.eu/tatom/&#34;&#62;Text Analysis with Topic Models&#60;/a&#62; is another good set of tutorials, though you need to have some Python basics down first. &#60;a href=&#34;http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/&#34;&#62;Learn Python the Hard Way&#60;/a&#62; is (despite the name) a very good place to start. Another good language to learn is PHP, which is the basis for Wordpress. It may be the easiest language (along with Javascript) to extend the functionality of your websites. In all these cases, there is a wealth of code samples and discussion about how to do things on stackoverflow.com.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Leah - it helps to have a pretty good sense of what it is you want to be doing, I think. Otherwise, all of the tutorials one might follow quickly become too abstract. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some folks have found codeacademy.com very helpful; it might be more useful for you, to start, to look at some 'how did they make that?' videos or articles: &#60;a href=&#34;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that-the-video/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that-the-video/&#60;/a&#62;  and &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Programming Historian has lots of great stuff, and we're setting up a kind of community work-through-the-tutorials-and-annotate-them-where-things-get-tricksy (see &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/02/DHannotates&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/02/DHannotates&#60;/a&#62; ). Depending on where you're starting from, you might also find things like workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca  or themacroscope.org helpful (things I've written for my own class).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In the top right corner, there is a tab that says &#34;Logged in as&#34; with your username. Click on your username, and it will take you to your profile. Click on &#34;edit,&#34; and you will see a place to change your password.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm a PhD in English student, and I'm interested in (but very new to) DH. I will start working with TEI soon through a digital archive project I'm working on, so there's that. What other avenues should I explore in my quest to learn coding for the sake of DH research?
