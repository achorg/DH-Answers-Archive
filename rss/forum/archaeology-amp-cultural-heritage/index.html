			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear Patrick and quinnanya:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks a lot for the responses and suggestions to seek funds. I have been exploring opportunities in India for funding, and have come to the conclusion that funding specifically for a dh based project is very minimal. The ones available are through STEM related streams and difficult to tap if you project is not aligned with their objectives. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, I would be looking for project based funding wherein I can break out my larger project into smaller short-term projects. Do keep me posted about any funding opportunities that can be applied for.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks once again&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You might also want to follow and/or get in touch with the DHAsia initiative at Stanford, which seems to have been launched today: &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhasia.org/2015/06/introducing-dhasia/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dhasia.org/2015/06/introducing-dhasia/&#60;/a&#62;. There's not a lot of details available so far, but the geographic scope, at least, includes India.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I get the sense that the vast majority of members and knowledge here is still centered on North America and Europe, so I fear that we might not be a good knowledge-source yet.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Have you asked around at your institution, or among other colleagues that you know in India, about grant sources that they have pursued, but might not be explicitly DH? It's possible that some funding agencies in India do not have a specific emphasis on DH, but would welcome a DH proposal (here in the US, the National Endowment for the Humanities was supporting DH projects before DH was a thing on the virtue of humanities relevance, regardless of technology).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In my experience, different funding sources will or will not provide funds for different things. For example, some will fund digitization work and equipment, some won't. Keep in mind, too, that every applicant for a grant truly believes that their idea is of very high quality. Reviewers will be obligated to assess the quality based on the criteria that are described in the grant application process, so 'quality' will always be measured against each individual program's criteria and guidelines.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the response. While I have been exploring opportunities for funding in India, and have got a small grant (which is yet to materialise) to initiate the project, it would be very beneficial if the grant period is more than 2 years.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Typically I am looking for grants that would cover the following costs:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;a) Infrastructure and Equipment - Computers, Storage, Network setup and Archiving&#60;br /&#62;
b) Travel&#60;br /&#62;
c) Project Associates&#60;br /&#62;
d) Seminars/Conferences/Workshops for taking this project forward&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As far as the quality of the idea goes, I believe that such a project has immense potential in terms of tangible outcomes for researchers and institutions. The first aim is to create an online digital map of exhibition spaces and points, next I would be mapping these areas for elaborating a history of public culture in regional India.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Do let me know if some avenues are available for applying.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm not familiar with research funding in India. I presume you are in India?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You're not likely elligible for any national funding from countries other than India. But you would be eligible for various small or independent grants from a range of scholarly societies and charities. Your success would depend on your credentials and the quality of your idea.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To give you a decent answer, I think we'd need to know a bit more about how much money you'd need, and for what.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have initiated a project related to the history of film exhibition and public culture in Indian cities. I am looking to fund this project to expand its applicability, scope and geography. Can someone let me know of any funding agencies who would support this effort?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Prosopographies are the next big thing in Classical Studies, and there's a tremendous amount of work being done in the library and archival communities with aligning name authority systems to enable large-scale aggregation and access to LAM content. EAC-CPF is an emerging standard for the description of people, families, and corporate bodies, but TEI has also been used for prosopographies ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Prosopography&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Prosopography&#60;/a&#62; ), and certainly TEI could serve as a container for more detailed individual biographies. As for EAC-CPF, the highest-profile project is IATH's Social Networks and Archival Context Project ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/&#60;/a&#62; ). It is still in the prototype phase, but it contains several million entity records derived from name authority files and archival finding aids contributed by dozens of organizations (OCLC, Library of Congress, BnF, Getty, etc.). SNAC will eventually evolve into an international consortium maintaining millions of entities, each expressed as a URI in semantic web terms. Holders of content will be able to link their records to SNAC identifiers. The specific workflow is a bit fuzzy at the moment, but the end goal is to allow researchers of, say, Thomas Jefferson, to view the EAC-CPF record of Jefferson, and archival materials held at multiple institutions will be made available through one interface.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A similar project is evolving in the Classical Studies community: Standards for Networking Ancient Prosopographies (SNAP, &#60;a href=&#34;http://snapdrgn.net/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://snapdrgn.net/&#60;/a&#62; ). The idea here is to align various prosopographies in linked open data methodologies to enable the aggregation of content based on people as well as experiment with social network graphs. A researcher of Augustus would be able to read biographical information as well as gain access to epigraphy mentioning him, coins and statues depicting him, or architectural monuments that he commissioned. The model for this project is Pelagios ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/&#60;/a&#62; ), which has similarly aggregated content based on ancient geographical places defined by Pleiades ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://pleiades.stoa.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://pleiades.stoa.org/&#60;/a&#62; ). I am planning on participating in this initiative in several capacities. We are beginning to build a prosopography of the Roman Empire, formed in EAC-CPF initially generated from open data and supplemented by biographical context added through an EAC-CPF editor that I have been developing for about 18 months called xEAC ( &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ewg118/xEAC&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/ewg118/xEAC&#60;/a&#62; ).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, back to your point about individual biographies. EAC-CPF is more data-oriented than document-oriented, so TEI is a more capable vessel for individual biographies. There's an awful lot you can do in TEI: implement machine readable dates, link places mentioned in texts to gazetteers on the web (like Geonames.org), link related or mentioned people to resources defined on SNAC. So you could build your biography from the ground up to become part of the larger linked open data cloud while simultaneously being able to harness existing web services to gather and display content related to people and places that you've tagged in your TEI. Suppose you've written a biography of Thomas Jefferson. You've linked your record to the SNAC-defined URI for Jefferson. SNAC would eventually be able to harvest some RDF or EAC-CPF about your person so that when a researcher comes to the SNAC portal for Jefferson, he or she will be able to follow links back to your biography, archival materials held at the University of Virginia, or books by or about him that have been catalogued in Worldcat.

&#60;p&#62;Responded on Twitter, but for the archive of the question here: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We used Dublin Core fields behind Omeka to catalog individual hardware components from some of MITH's vintage computers: &#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This reflects strength and weakness of both DC and Omeka itself. What an &#34;Item&#34; is is left completely up to you and your interpretation. That chains down to how to interpret the DC fields depending a bit on how you define an &#34;Item&#34;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In your case, it might be helpful to create item types. One could be &#34;Particular Component&#34; (i.e., yours) and one could be &#34;Component Type&#34; for the general class.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd probably call Synertek the creator, and probably make &#34;Fabrication Place&#34; as item type metadata.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've got my students working on an assignment where we take apart old media devices, learn about their key components, and then create an Omeka exhibit about our device, using Neatline to trace each component in time and space. This part works pretty well, so far.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For example, I'm taking apart an Atari VCS. The MOS 6507 CPU bears the MOS technologies logo so was probably (I've learned) manufactured at their plant in Norristown, PA. The TIA chip, on the other hand, has a Synertek logo which (I've learned) second-sourced many of the integrated circuits used by Atari. Even though Atari's TIA chip (the famous Stella) was originally fabricated by MOS in Pennsylvania, &#60;em&#62;mine&#60;/em&#62; was produce at Synertek in California. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My problem is, I want to capture that kind of distinction in my record, but I'm not sure how to use Omeka's Dublin Core fields to describe everything that I find interesting about these chips, including those differences in production sites. My understanding of DC is pretty basic -- for example, does it make a distinction between &#34;The TIA Chip&#34; as a class of objects exhibiting uniform properties, vs. &#34;My TIA Chip&#34; which has a specific origin in time and place? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In other words, is Synertek the &#34;creator&#34;, &#34;publisher&#34;, or &#34;source&#34;? And what does &#34;coverage&#34; mean?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Am I over-thinking this? Are there better ontologies for this kind of archive?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I welcome any and all suggestions. Thanks for your time.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I just want to echo what Devon wrote --- so clearly and accurately --- three days ago (tho I will confess I haven't used the Ultimaker). And I agree: the Make Mag roundup is a fantastic reference. I was quite surprised by it, in the best possible way.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;At the MLab, we've been using The Replicator Dual. Consensus seems to be that the Replicator 2 is a better bet, especially because of the shift from ABS to PLA. Also, on the Dual, the heated build plate is not ideal. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You might also want to consider modelling, prototyping, and editing software. We've been using a combination of 123D Catch, Mudbox, SketchUp, netfabb, and MeshLab. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hope this helps!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've recently been using the Makerbot Replicator 2 quite a bit, and haven't had any problems with it. The high quality setting results in nice prints, and their latest MakerWare software is easy-to-use. If you're looking for a printer that prints well, out-of-the-box with little in the way of calibration and maintenance, I recommend it. What calibration it does require is done on-board, via a small LCD screen and simple push-button interface. You don't need the machine tethered to computer, as it prints easily off an SD card. It only prints in PLA -- so if you were hoping to print in ABS, you'll want to look at a different machine with a heated build platform. I like printing in PLA more than with ABS for a number of reasons. I thin the Makerbot is the easiest to get into printing things -- the machine works with only a minor calibration (levelling the build platform) and the software is hassle-free. The print quality is also among the best I've seen among a variety of machines &#38;gt;$3000.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Ultimaker is another one I've seen very good quality prints come from, and it's also quite fast at printing. Documentation is a bit less for it, and you can get it as a kit to assemble. For the best quality prints (at least in the example I saw), extra pieces had to first be printed on the printer, and then added to the machine to tighten some parts up. The results were outstanding, though -- very high quality prints. &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ultimaker.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.ultimaker.com/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We've liked using 3D printer kits. In the past, we used Makerbot kits that always went together well, were well-documented, and printed fine. Makerbot seems to have moved on fromt he kit business, though, so for kits, we've been building Printrbots. We've been using the Printrbot Jr., a small printer that only works with PLA, and is about $400. The print-quality is decent, particularly at that price point. They're releasing an even smaller kit for $299, and they have larger models as well. The Printrbot Jr. also folds up flat, so it's easier to pack up and take places. &#60;a href=&#34;http://printrbot.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://printrbot.com/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Make Magazine published a roundup of 3D printers within the past year.
