			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, I agree with you in many ways. There is unarguably a huge generation gap. Clearly there was no internet when I finished college in the early 90's.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My 9 year old daughter hardly keeps the smart phone down. She keeps fiddling with it after school, playing one those online kid games. As a father, I am unable to say no. I allow her to play a couple of hours nevertheless fearing that she would be left behind in a world where everyone is so information savvy and so ingrained in the digital culture. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I do not know if I am doing the right thing.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Your prescriptions for managing distraction are good but may not work for everybody. As you rightly said it depends on one's profession and livelihood. Working in a corporate world and some times on virtual mode it becomes utmost necessity to be on top of things. It's a race, lest you are not in the good books of your boss. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Meditative or not I think it works when you take it (Information) as it comes and not voluntarily be too hungry to seek it unless there is a dire need. Just keep the intention alive and look around. It works. For me honestly, only in spurts!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I listen to NPR, fresh air once in a while.Your words at the very end were good. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;Snowflakes are falling in abundance outside my window. I paused while drafting this answer to watch them. &#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Cheers, Ramkumar

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I in general think that answer to this question differs for scholars and for general public. In order to do scholarship, which for me are activities of writing, reading, transcribing, researching, encoding and formatting texts, it takes hours of uninterrupted time. To be productive, I resort to several practices which in our era of information overload seem almost like monkish or meditative, including the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) No smartphone. Never bought one, originally because expensive, later because decided it was a time sink and source of interruptions. Not having one has mostly eliminated the sleep problem.&#60;br /&#62;
2) Limit social network usage to minimum (no Facebook, never signed up; did use Twitter several years, now mostly in hiatus)&#60;br /&#62;
3) Anti-distraction software on desktop (Macintosh SelfControl, which blocks access to time-wasting web sites)&#60;br /&#62;
4) No 24-hour TV news (no cable)&#60;br /&#62;
5) Over time cultivated and developed preference for austere and regimented software interaction, plain text with RegEx manipulation, LaTeX, well-formedness and validity in XML, citation keys with Zotero, etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Sustained scholarly engagement demands immense rigor. And I usually fall short of what I would hope, but the choices and habits above allow me to not feel particularly overwhelmed by digital culture. These obviously cannot be adopted by everyone. I'm past middle-age and long-time partnered, so I have no urgency to keep up with youth culture or to date. A public or activist scholarship would likely be unable to restrict itself to such methods. And I wonder how a scholar of gaming culture can resist the allure of just playing games. But over time I've satisfied myself that being aware of the daily political news or sports or cultural events lacks the urgency that I once felt toward it.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I was  influenced by listening to a scholar on NPR several years ago, perhaps on FreshAir. An eminent, productive scholar, she described limiting her access to the news so she could concentrate on her work One day her mother (the scholar's mother) wanted to talk about the fall of the Berlin Wall. And the scholar had to explain to her mother that she did not know that the Berlin Wall had &#34;fallen&#34; several days before--because she had restricted her consumption of the news. Her mother said something like, &#34;I don't want to talk to anyone who does not even know about the fall of the Berlin wall,&#34; and hung up the phone. The scholar, at first in some consternation because her mother had hung up on her, resigned herself to her choice, though she protested to the radio audience that she usually learned about major events within a week or two (i.e., her mother had told her),  and remained sufficiently informed about the present. I wish I could recall the scholar's name, but her attitude seemed immensely sane to me. And I cut back on news consumption after hearing that interview. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't think it's easy to draw line, but I do think it's possible and necessary to cultivate habits of information interaction that reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed, for scholars and the general public.  In my case, to concentrate on scholarship, it feels like I have to draw the lines with a degree of rigor that to the general public and my students seems excessive. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Snowflakes are falling in abundance outside my window. I paused while drafting this answer to watch them. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Best, Wesley

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;br /&#62;
We are frequently overwhelmed with digital information. We do not switch off our smart phones and devices till late in the night this disturbs our sleep and on top of it, there is enough distraction at work during the day. How do we deal with this ?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have personally seen many people on social networks having an emotional breakdown and have gone into depression either due the over-exposure or their ideas and posts not being paid attention to.  They are unable to deal with this exposure and overload of information. As a society, are we going too fast on the information super lane? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We are not paying enough attention. Human attention span on any piece of useful information is only about 3-4 minutes and beyond this is distraction. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;How do we practice being selective and where do we draw the line ? are the other things that come to my mind right now.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you have thoughts or comments please do share. Would greatly appreciate. Cheers, Ramkumar

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear Patrick and quinnanya:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks a lot for the responses and suggestions to seek funds. I have been exploring opportunities in India for funding, and have come to the conclusion that funding specifically for a dh based project is very minimal. The ones available are through STEM related streams and difficult to tap if you project is not aligned with their objectives. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, I would be looking for project based funding wherein I can break out my larger project into smaller short-term projects. Do keep me posted about any funding opportunities that can be applied for.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks once again&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You might also want to follow and/or get in touch with the DHAsia initiative at Stanford, which seems to have been launched today: &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhasia.org/2015/06/introducing-dhasia/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dhasia.org/2015/06/introducing-dhasia/&#60;/a&#62;. There's not a lot of details available so far, but the geographic scope, at least, includes India.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I get the sense that the vast majority of members and knowledge here is still centered on North America and Europe, so I fear that we might not be a good knowledge-source yet.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Have you asked around at your institution, or among other colleagues that you know in India, about grant sources that they have pursued, but might not be explicitly DH? It's possible that some funding agencies in India do not have a specific emphasis on DH, but would welcome a DH proposal (here in the US, the National Endowment for the Humanities was supporting DH projects before DH was a thing on the virtue of humanities relevance, regardless of technology).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In my experience, different funding sources will or will not provide funds for different things. For example, some will fund digitization work and equipment, some won't. Keep in mind, too, that every applicant for a grant truly believes that their idea is of very high quality. Reviewers will be obligated to assess the quality based on the criteria that are described in the grant application process, so 'quality' will always be measured against each individual program's criteria and guidelines.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the response. While I have been exploring opportunities for funding in India, and have got a small grant (which is yet to materialise) to initiate the project, it would be very beneficial if the grant period is more than 2 years.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Typically I am looking for grants that would cover the following costs:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;a) Infrastructure and Equipment - Computers, Storage, Network setup and Archiving&#60;br /&#62;
b) Travel&#60;br /&#62;
c) Project Associates&#60;br /&#62;
d) Seminars/Conferences/Workshops for taking this project forward&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As far as the quality of the idea goes, I believe that such a project has immense potential in terms of tangible outcomes for researchers and institutions. The first aim is to create an online digital map of exhibition spaces and points, next I would be mapping these areas for elaborating a history of public culture in regional India.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Do let me know if some avenues are available for applying.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm not familiar with research funding in India. I presume you are in India?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You're not likely elligible for any national funding from countries other than India. But you would be eligible for various small or independent grants from a range of scholarly societies and charities. Your success would depend on your credentials and the quality of your idea.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To give you a decent answer, I think we'd need to know a bit more about how much money you'd need, and for what.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have initiated a project related to the history of film exhibition and public culture in Indian cities. I am looking to fund this project to expand its applicability, scope and geography. Can someone let me know of any funding agencies who would support this effort?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Prosopographies are the next big thing in Classical Studies, and there's a tremendous amount of work being done in the library and archival communities with aligning name authority systems to enable large-scale aggregation and access to LAM content. EAC-CPF is an emerging standard for the description of people, families, and corporate bodies, but TEI has also been used for prosopographies ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Prosopography&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Prosopography&#60;/a&#62; ), and certainly TEI could serve as a container for more detailed individual biographies. As for EAC-CPF, the highest-profile project is IATH's Social Networks and Archival Context Project ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/&#60;/a&#62; ). It is still in the prototype phase, but it contains several million entity records derived from name authority files and archival finding aids contributed by dozens of organizations (OCLC, Library of Congress, BnF, Getty, etc.). SNAC will eventually evolve into an international consortium maintaining millions of entities, each expressed as a URI in semantic web terms. Holders of content will be able to link their records to SNAC identifiers. The specific workflow is a bit fuzzy at the moment, but the end goal is to allow researchers of, say, Thomas Jefferson, to view the EAC-CPF record of Jefferson, and archival materials held at multiple institutions will be made available through one interface.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A similar project is evolving in the Classical Studies community: Standards for Networking Ancient Prosopographies (SNAP, &#60;a href=&#34;http://snapdrgn.net/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://snapdrgn.net/&#60;/a&#62; ). The idea here is to align various prosopographies in linked open data methodologies to enable the aggregation of content based on people as well as experiment with social network graphs. A researcher of Augustus would be able to read biographical information as well as gain access to epigraphy mentioning him, coins and statues depicting him, or architectural monuments that he commissioned. The model for this project is Pelagios ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/&#60;/a&#62; ), which has similarly aggregated content based on ancient geographical places defined by Pleiades ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://pleiades.stoa.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://pleiades.stoa.org/&#60;/a&#62; ). I am planning on participating in this initiative in several capacities. We are beginning to build a prosopography of the Roman Empire, formed in EAC-CPF initially generated from open data and supplemented by biographical context added through an EAC-CPF editor that I have been developing for about 18 months called xEAC ( &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ewg118/xEAC&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/ewg118/xEAC&#60;/a&#62; ).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, back to your point about individual biographies. EAC-CPF is more data-oriented than document-oriented, so TEI is a more capable vessel for individual biographies. There's an awful lot you can do in TEI: implement machine readable dates, link places mentioned in texts to gazetteers on the web (like Geonames.org), link related or mentioned people to resources defined on SNAC. So you could build your biography from the ground up to become part of the larger linked open data cloud while simultaneously being able to harness existing web services to gather and display content related to people and places that you've tagged in your TEI. Suppose you've written a biography of Thomas Jefferson. You've linked your record to the SNAC-defined URI for Jefferson. SNAC would eventually be able to harvest some RDF or EAC-CPF about your person so that when a researcher comes to the SNAC portal for Jefferson, he or she will be able to follow links back to your biography, archival materials held at the University of Virginia, or books by or about him that have been catalogued in Worldcat.

She has been developing a markup schema called BESS (Biographical Elements and Structure Schema) for identifying and analyzing common structures in individual biographies.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does digital humanities hold any promise for the writing of individual biographies, or is one life too small to crunch with big data?&#60;/p&#62;

&#60;p&#62;Responded on Twitter, but for the archive of the question here: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We used Dublin Core fields behind Omeka to catalog individual hardware components from some of MITH's vintage computers: &#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This reflects strength and weakness of both DC and Omeka itself. What an &#34;Item&#34; is is left completely up to you and your interpretation. That chains down to how to interpret the DC fields depending a bit on how you define an &#34;Item&#34;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In your case, it might be helpful to create item types. One could be &#34;Particular Component&#34; (i.e., yours) and one could be &#34;Component Type&#34; for the general class.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd probably call Synertek the creator, and probably make &#34;Fabrication Place&#34; as item type metadata.
