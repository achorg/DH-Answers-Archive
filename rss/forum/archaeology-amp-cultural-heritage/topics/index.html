			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have initiated a project related to the history of film exhibition and public culture in Indian cities. I am looking to fund this project to expand its applicability, scope and geography. Can someone let me know of any funding agencies who would support this effort?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've got my students working on an assignment where we take apart old media devices, learn about their key components, and then create an Omeka exhibit about our device, using Neatline to trace each component in time and space. This part works pretty well, so far.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For example, I'm taking apart an Atari VCS. The MOS 6507 CPU bears the MOS technologies logo so was probably (I've learned) manufactured at their plant in Norristown, PA. The TIA chip, on the other hand, has a Synertek logo which (I've learned) second-sourced many of the integrated circuits used by Atari. Even though Atari's TIA chip (the famous Stella) was originally fabricated by MOS in Pennsylvania, &#60;em&#62;mine&#60;/em&#62; was produce at Synertek in California. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My problem is, I want to capture that kind of distinction in my record, but I'm not sure how to use Omeka's Dublin Core fields to describe everything that I find interesting about these chips, including those differences in production sites. My understanding of DC is pretty basic -- for example, does it make a distinction between &#34;The TIA Chip&#34; as a class of objects exhibiting uniform properties, vs. &#34;My TIA Chip&#34; which has a specific origin in time and place? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In other words, is Synertek the &#34;creator&#34;, &#34;publisher&#34;, or &#34;source&#34;? And what does &#34;coverage&#34; mean?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Am I over-thinking this? Are there better ontologies for this kind of archive?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I welcome any and all suggestions. Thanks for your time.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Zach

			<description>&#60;p&#62;3D printing is evolving at a breakneck speed with decent machines becoming available at affordable prices. I'd be very grateful for any recommendations from people who have shopped for or deployed 3D printers recently in the context of DH. I wish I could say more about the planned usage, but I guess it's best to say that it's meant to be versatile. I'm imagining something in the $2-10k range though that could changed based on desirable features. My current point of reference is something like a &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.makerbot.com/&#34;&#62;MakerBot&#60;/a&#62;. Thanks in advance!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi folks. I wondered if anyone had come across any research that uses computational methods to look at perspective in art, such as in renaissance oil paintings, or foreshortening in sculpture, etc. I am sure there is a method to do this, but not sure if anyone has applied it to a corpus of paintings to understand the artist's use of perspective better. If you have any pointers at all I'd be glad to hear about them.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks! &#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What resources would you recommend for introducing librarians to what DH is and what it can do? Examples of DH/library projects would be great, as well as sites that explain field and link out to more resources? (other than ACH, of course!) thanks

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everybody,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am looking for a very powerful data visualization tool for historians.  A professor has been teaching his students R in his Quantitative Methods class but (understandably) feels that the learning curve is too steep.  He was asking me about creating a user interface for R but, before we think about how to go down that path, I thought I should check with the community.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, any thoughts?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;My colleague has a collection of stereoscopic views from the 19th century that he'd like to reproduce online, in such a way that they appear in 3d, without the need for a stereoscopic viewer. I know this isn't exactly a digital humanities type question, but on the other hand, I figured if anybody'd know, it'd be around here. Thank you!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm making a tech request to upgrade/renovate/build a tech lab for the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative here at MSU (chi.matrix.msu.edu).  I've got some general ideas as to what is going to be in the request.  However, I thought I would throw the question out to the community and see if people had suggestions for purchases - stuff that I may not have thought about.  These could include software, hardware, peripherals, online services &#38;amp; sites, etc.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This lab would mostly be used for cultural heritage informatics projects - anthropology, archaeology, history, classics, art history, museology, historic geography, etc.  (though, that hardly is a good representation of the kinds of things that it might end up being used for).  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, what would you request?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Do you know of any existing open-source tools that can handle the layered visualization of historic data on maps and the visualization of that data over time? Like, extract data out of a relational database and layered to create different visualizations. Or something like this?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have the opportunity to develop a proposal to work with Brown's visualization group - supercomputers, a CAVE for 3-D presentation, great computer imaging possibilities. I've come up with schemes involving presentation of artifacts and landscapes... but I'm sure there are other possibilities, either that someone's tried, or someone has considered trying. What's the state of the field, the most interesting work so far? What needs more research?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hey folks,&#60;br /&#62;
In response to some recent discussions about access to information about digital humanities from folks working in the cultural heritage sector, I decided to provide a quick start guide for those interested in finding more information about things digital that might relate to cultural heritage.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This list is only meant to be a starting point, and in no way final, definitive, or proscriptive. I am cross-posting this to DH Answers so that it can grow there in a forum setting and be more open. (If interested, you can read &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfortynine.org/2011/01/navigating-dh-for-cultural-heritage-professionals/&#34;&#62; &#60;/a&#62;)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Please add &#60;/strong&#62; to this and pass this around to your colleagues who do not follow DH'ers.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Find a &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org/&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mcn.edu/&#34;&#62;Museum Computer Network&#60;/a&#62; is a friendly association of GLAM and DH professionals. MCN sponsors a listserv, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mcn.edu/mcn-l&#34;&#62;MCN-L&#60;/a&#62;, and its website provides a number of good resources available to anyone.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;American Association of Museum's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/&#34;&#62;Media and Technology standing professional committee&#60;/a&#62;: This SPG sponsors tech-related sessions at AAM and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/muse/index.html&#34;&#62;MUSE awards&#60;/a&#62; that highlight exemplar uses of technology in museum galleries and in digital formats.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Attend technology-focused sessions at GLAM conferences&#60;br /&#62;
If you are not working in your institution's tech department, you can still attend sessions at a LAM conference. More tech-focused sessions are available at regional museum association meetings and professional conferences, and sometimes there are some strategy sessions that offer project management assistance or advise for choosing appropriate tools for specific projects.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digital-jumpstart.org/index.php/Topics&#34;&#62; Digital-JumpStart&#60;/a&#62;: sessions from NCPH and AAM 2010, offered opportunities for individuals to to benefit from the lessons learned by those more experienced in the field, and left a legacy with a wiki of resources on all kinds of GLAM-related topics.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.imls.gov/about/webwise.shtm&#34;&#62;Webwise&#60;/a&#62;: sponsored by the Institute for Museum and Library Services where representatives&#60;br /&#62;

&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Subscribe to Blogs&#60;br /&#62;
There are too many good blogs for me to list here, but I will recommend a few that can help you get started.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://musematic.net/&#34;&#62;Musematic&#60;/a&#62;: Written by members of AAM's Media and Technology standing professional committee.&#60;/li&#62;

&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/&#34;&#62;Digital Humanities Now&#60;/a&#62; created by Dan Cohen and Jeremy Boggs at the&#60;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu&#34;&#62; Center for History and New Media&#60;/a&#62;, is a real-time, crowdsourced publication. If you don't use Twitter, this helps pull out what people are talking about by taking the pulse of the digital humanities community and tries to discern what articles, blog posts, projects, tools, collections, and announcements are worthy of greater attention.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Participate in Online Forums&#60;br /&#62;
Most technology projects host forums for help questions (ie, &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/forums&#34;&#62;Omeka&#60;/a&#62;), but there are also some general forums that can be very helpful too.&#60;/p&#62;

&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers&#34;&#62;DH Answers&#60;/a&#62; is building a community-based Q&#38;amp;A board for digital humanities questions that need a longer answer than Twitter provides.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Experiment with Digital Tools&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://digitalresearchtools.pbworks.com/w/page/17801672/FrontPage&#34;&#62;Digital Research Tools wiki (DiRT)&#60;/a&#62;: DiRT is a good starting place for browsing summaries and reviews of scores of digital tools for you to play with or think about trying for a new project.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Take a Webinar&#60;br /&#62;
Some webinars are free, others are not. They all offer training and varying levels of interaction that occur at your desktop and do not require travel.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.oclc.org/research/events/taichi.htm&#34;&#62;OCLC TAI CHI&#60;/a&#62; series highlights innovative applications that libraries, museums and archives may find effective in their own environments, and teaches new technologies and skills.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;AAM offers a variety of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.aam-us.org/getinvolved/learn/ondemandwebinars.cfm&#34;&#62;professional development through webinars&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Participate on Twitter&#60;br /&#62;
Getting started on Twitter may seem overwhelming and may not be practical given your daily responsibilities at your institution. If you're interested in following some folks before participating yourself, here are a few lists to get you going. (Not sure &#60;a href=&#34;http://digital-jumpstart.org/index.php/Social_Media&#34;&#62;how to get started on Twitter&#60;/a&#62;?)&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;At THATCamp New England, right now, we're talking about the practice some institutions have of digitizing public domain images and then putting all kinds of license restrictions on them.  This is probably not ideal: they're free to &#60;em&#62;sell&#60;/em&#62; those images, but putting restrictions on them seems sketchy.  On the other hand, they did digitize them and make them available.  For an example, see Matthew Battles' article &#60;a href=&#34;http://hilobrow.com/2010/10/07/space-for-sale/&#34;&#62;&#34;Space For Sale.&#34;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;An idea is being floated: what if image providers (cultural institutions and commercial providers) were required to put up a notice, something like: &#34;The content of this image is in the public domain.  You may be able to find a free copy of it elsewhere.&#34;?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If we were to assume that restricting the use of public domain images is not best practice, what are institutional examples of best practice?  What institutions fall short of best practice?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It seems to us that the Getty example in Battles' article falls under the latter category.  Google Books (see &#60;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#38;amp;answer=44666&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=43738&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;) seems to follow best practice.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To be clear: most of these thoughts are not mine but the collective's.  :)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is perhaps a simplistic question, but as I prepare to discuss Digital Humanities with other departments on my campus, the need for articulating the relevance of Digital Humanities to a Dance Department are on my mind.  How have you articulated DH to the performance-based arts? Have you encountered resistance from the Arts in collaborating under the Humanities umbrella? What tools are used for preservation or data mining in the Arts?  ARTeFact comes to mind for dance. Music has &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.diggingintodata.org/Home/AwardRecipients2009/StructuralAnalysisofLargeAmountsofMusic/tabid/179/Default.aspx&#34;&#62;SALAMI&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://music-encoding.org/&#34;&#62;MEI&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(I'm not even sure where this kind of question should be housed on DH Answers.)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A coworker of mine is looking for suggestions, trying to find material about the point of convergence between digital humanities and public history museums. I can think of a couple, but as I'm fairly new to the museum side of things, I thought I'd turn the question over to a larger body of folks who're in the know.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What should one read, if one is looking to sound well-informed when talking about such topics?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(Also, why is there no &#34;public humanities&#34; related category...?)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
