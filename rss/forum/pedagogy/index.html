			<description>&#60;p&#62;YES!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Check out the in-progress collection: Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A few keywords that might have assignments and syllabi that fit your needs:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Archive: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/archive.md&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/archive.md&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
Interface: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/interface.md&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/interface.md&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
Poetry: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/poetry.md&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/keywords/poetry.md&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And many, many others. Each keyword has a list of 10 pedagogical artifacts. Feel free to use those materials right now. A finalized published version of the entire collection will be stabilized by January 2017. For now, we continue adding keywords and going through open peer review.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am helping to develop teaching modules around a collection of digitized texts and artefacts, so that non-expert instructors and teachers can integrate these texts into their courses. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Can anyone think of examples of strong teaching modules/guides/plans that are freely available online?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;br /&#62;
I'm putting together assignments for next semester's digital history class, and want to construct a simple distant reading for my students, probably using Voyant Tools (unless there is a very easy-to-use pure HTML/Javascript set of tools that will let my students use some of the basic JS skills they'll have acquired in their previous assignment).  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would like to present them with existing corpora of historical texts: preferably not literature, but newspapers/government documents, letters etc. Most archives I've found use PDF images with mediocre to poor OCR.  Can anyone point me to a good collection of historical corpora that students can experiment with?  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Sure. Right now I have no travel plans for July. When you're ready, drop me a note. I'm going to be working on the repo some in June, and I'm making a note to add the PDF. Part of my plan is also to turn chunks of it into an iPython notebook (now Jupyter) which would allow there to be a mix of exposition (written in Markdown) with code that can be executed live. (I have a pretty complete run-down on how to set all this up on a Mac, if anyone is interested.)

&#60;p&#62;Thanks very much, John! I'd love to review the PDF version, too, and talk to you about exercises. Perhaps in July when I start developing the course? You can reach me at ullyot[@]ucalgary[.]ca or @&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/ullyot'&#62;ullyot&#60;/a&#62; on Twitter.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you want something intermediate between Codecademy's Python tutorials and Jockers' R, as well as a small text through which you can work methodically with your students, I've got a small collection of commented Python scripts in a GitHub repository. It comes with a plain text version of &#34;The Most Dangerous Game.&#34; I can also include a PDF version I've long used, which gives you a paginated source for comparison. If you're interested, I can also add notes on the exercises/activities that I use in conjunction with the text. (Essentially, I use it as a way to get students thinking about both the advantages of working through the particularities of texts computationally -- e.g., KWiC -- as well as some of the underlying statistics behind things like topic modeling.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's the repo: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/johnlaudun/upst&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/johnlaudun/upst&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I’m designing the graduate seminar I’ll teach in the Department of English this fall (2015) on the subject of ‘Algorithmic Criticism,’ a title I took from the subtitle of Stephen Ramsay’s 2011 book, Reading Machines. It’s an introduction to computational text-analysis for students of literature, from word frequency to topic modelling.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;By the end of the course, students will be comfortable moving between close reading and distant reading, or what Matthew Jockers calls micro-, meso-, and macro-analysis. (Along with Ramsay’s book, Jockers’ 2013 study Macroanalysis and his 2014 guide to Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature will be required readings.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Students will learn and implement some programming basics using Python and R, so they can see what happens when natural-language processing and other tools parse and rearrange the words in both individual texts and larger corpora. I haven’t developed more detailed course outcomes than that. We’ll use Codecademy’s Python tutorials alongside Jockers’ book on R.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So which literary texts do you assign for old-fashioned linear close readings in a course like this? They should be long enough to have a lot of words to work with, and complex enough that they contain a lot of topics. They should provide good contrasts with each other – that is, contain a lot of different words and topics – yet be close enough in time that the comparison makes sense. And they should be in the public domain, so we have texts to manipulate in whatever repository we’re drawing them from.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There will be more info coming via the Omeka forums, and/or some direct contact as we plan how to publicize the information.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It was just a few months ago that we got our first request for a VPAT from an institution. The guided a lot of what went into Omeka 2.3, and we're likely to publish the results of that evaluation soon -- just not sure where and how yet in our strategy.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I can say that student-produced work is unlikely to be an issue. The real issue is the themes that are used. That is, Omeka, like other CMSs, happily lets people enter data, then the themes to the lion's share of the work for accessibility. Admittedly, that can cause issues if there is a custom theme that doesn't address accessibility. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My suspicion, though, is that a VPAT assessment is more likely to be a tool for folks to know what to expect and what not, and what an institution's accessibility office might need to address to make sure content is available to all. That is, I suspect it is more informational that prescriptive for institutions, and that over the long term that information should inform future work.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That's my guess, though, so definitely want to hear additional info.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've posted this directly to the Omeka Forum (Feature Requests) but think it may have future impact for many types of DH projects/tools so hope folsk will weigh in:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Our department (Center for Teaching and Learning) at U of Vermont has a small Omeka space that contains exhibits built by students as part of class projects. (Feel free to take a look: &#60;a href=&#34;http://badger.uvm.edu/omeka/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://badger.uvm.edu/omeka/)&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The university is planning a campus-wide accessibility review of the current use of technology, web-based tools, and public program information related to learning and instruction and campus communications, programs, and information.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The accessibility review will include examining web-based tools that we support by using the “Voluntary Product Accessibility Template” - the rubric that the federal government uses to ensure that new software products are accessible and will meet the WCAG 2.0 AA standard:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.state.gov/m/irm/impact/126343.htm&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.state.gov/m/irm/impact/126343.htm&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While the planning is still in progress for how the review will be done, the question of our Omeka site has come up, especially since it is built by students and so needs to be accessible both to viewers and builders.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've searched the Omeka Forums for accessibility information and have found some information about improvements in 2.3 but would like to know if anyone can point me to a more comprehensive list of accessibility features or if the VPAT template linked above has been considered as a guide to future accessibility features.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would hate to our growing Omeka exhibits get shut down. These are wonderful opportunities for students to create exhibits and collections based on historic documents and objects. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;- Hope

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I guess this topic was originally posted before I finished my MA. I got my MA in classical archaeology from the University of Virginia in 2013. Instead of a traditional research project, I wrote on the technical underpinnings of the Roman coin projects we are doing at the American Numismatic Society and the application of linked data to the UVA numismatic collection, which was basically the culmination of my academic career up to that point. The digital projects weren't accepted in lieu of a thesis however, and they should not have been. The thesis provided a background of the history of the description of coins from the Renaissance to the database era and beyond, with specific use cases detailing the digital future of the discipline. The thesis was basically the digital state of the field in 2013.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not sure that a written thesis should be removed altogether. &#60;em&#62;Something&#60;/em&#62; should be written to place the project into context.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
