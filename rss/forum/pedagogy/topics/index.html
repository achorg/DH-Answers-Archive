			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am helping to develop teaching modules around a collection of digitized texts and artefacts, so that non-expert instructors and teachers can integrate these texts into their courses. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Can anyone think of examples of strong teaching modules/guides/plans that are freely available online?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;br /&#62;
I'm putting together assignments for next semester's digital history class, and want to construct a simple distant reading for my students, probably using Voyant Tools (unless there is a very easy-to-use pure HTML/Javascript set of tools that will let my students use some of the basic JS skills they'll have acquired in their previous assignment).  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would like to present them with existing corpora of historical texts: preferably not literature, but newspapers/government documents, letters etc. Most archives I've found use PDF images with mediocre to poor OCR.  Can anyone point me to a good collection of historical corpora that students can experiment with?  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I’m designing the graduate seminar I’ll teach in the Department of English this fall (2015) on the subject of ‘Algorithmic Criticism,’ a title I took from the subtitle of Stephen Ramsay’s 2011 book, Reading Machines. It’s an introduction to computational text-analysis for students of literature, from word frequency to topic modelling.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;By the end of the course, students will be comfortable moving between close reading and distant reading, or what Matthew Jockers calls micro-, meso-, and macro-analysis. (Along with Ramsay’s book, Jockers’ 2013 study Macroanalysis and his 2014 guide to Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature will be required readings.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Students will learn and implement some programming basics using Python and R, so they can see what happens when natural-language processing and other tools parse and rearrange the words in both individual texts and larger corpora. I haven’t developed more detailed course outcomes than that. We’ll use Codecademy’s Python tutorials alongside Jockers’ book on R.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So which literary texts do you assign for old-fashioned linear close readings in a course like this? They should be long enough to have a lot of words to work with, and complex enough that they contain a lot of topics. They should provide good contrasts with each other – that is, contain a lot of different words and topics – yet be close enough in time that the comparison makes sense. And they should be in the public domain, so we have texts to manipulate in whatever repository we’re drawing them from.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've posted this directly to the Omeka Forum (Feature Requests) but think it may have future impact for many types of DH projects/tools so hope folsk will weigh in:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Our department (Center for Teaching and Learning) at U of Vermont has a small Omeka space that contains exhibits built by students as part of class projects. (Feel free to take a look: &#60;a href=&#34;http://badger.uvm.edu/omeka/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://badger.uvm.edu/omeka/)&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The university is planning a campus-wide accessibility review of the current use of technology, web-based tools, and public program information related to learning and instruction and campus communications, programs, and information.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The accessibility review will include examining web-based tools that we support by using the “Voluntary Product Accessibility Template” - the rubric that the federal government uses to ensure that new software products are accessible and will meet the WCAG 2.0 AA standard:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.state.gov/m/irm/impact/126343.htm&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.state.gov/m/irm/impact/126343.htm&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While the planning is still in progress for how the review will be done, the question of our Omeka site has come up, especially since it is built by students and so needs to be accessible both to viewers and builders.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've searched the Omeka Forums for accessibility information and have found some information about improvements in 2.3 but would like to know if anyone can point me to a more comprehensive list of accessibility features or if the VPAT template linked above has been considered as a guide to future accessibility features.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would hate to our growing Omeka exhibits get shut down. These are wonderful opportunities for students to create exhibits and collections based on historic documents and objects. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;- Hope

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi all!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I’m looking for examples of humanities or history departments that allow students to produce digital products for MA thesis and/or PhD dissertation credit. Better yet, I’d like to find language from departmental operating papers or catalogs about accepting digital work for graduate credit.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My history department at a regional masters comprehensive university is considering allowing students to produce digital products for the MA in lieu of the traditional history thesis. If possible, I’d like to draw on examples from other departments that are already doing this rather than inventing the procedures from scratch. Any ideas or recommendations?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For all you grad students out there, I’d like to mention that this idea came from several students doing innovative projects. If you believe in innovative digital scholarship, keep pushing for it!&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Greetings all.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;At SF State, a group of colleagues and I are starting the groundwork for an undergraduate DH credential - - most probably college-wide (College of Liberal and Creative Arts).  I've put together a &#60;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aj9SVHHhgZCZUktZPJ1HMTthsq5Jp0Dz8huAWc2jjdE/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&#62;google doc of resources&#60;/a&#62; for our working group which includes examples of undergraduate programs (minors, concentrations, etc.) at other institutions.  I've worked through &#60;a href=&#34;http://tanyaclement.org/2009/11/04/digital-humanities-inflected-undergraduate-programs-2/&#34;&#62;Tanya Clement's list&#60;/a&#62; - - which is now more than five years old.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone know of other undergraduate programs that I should add to my list?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks in advance.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am a Technology - Digital Media major, and I have to create a small Digital Humanities project for my English class. It doesn't have to be about English but I don't know quite what would be a digital humanities project or what kind of thing would be helpful? Or just some readings that would help me think of a project.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello - I am writing a proposal to renovate a traditional, fixed seating computer lab as a SCALE-UP style classroom suitable for teaching DH (among other things). What do you suggest for set up? Furniture, laptops, monitors, budget for software, etc. If anyone has a classroom and budget for a similar project, that would be especially helpful. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello,&#60;br /&#62;
This is my first post, I will try to be concise. I was very glad to find this page.&#60;br /&#62;
I am looking for a good master's program to study digital humanities in the US. I am currently residing in Romania.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have found it far more difficult than I had thought, to find these master's online. The only ones I've been able to locate are one at MIT and at the University of Maryland. I imagine there must be more...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would very much appreciate your help in finding some.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you!&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am currently studying information science, and I really wanna do my master in digital humanities. But if I wanna have any expectations of getting accepted does it mean that I will have to know how to/taken courses in programming?&#60;br /&#62;
The reason why I am asking on here is because I have been calling the university a lot, and no one can answer my question, and I really hope that someone on here can help me.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you for your time and help.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have been talking a lot these days to scholars who are new to the concept of digital humanities. They are aware of the new research questions that emerge in the field due to the vastly enlarged scale of studies and the ability to analyse big data. Can you provide examples of new research questions (inspired by digital humanities) that are not linked to the big data problem, something beyond the usual aspects of access to data and the scale of data? Your answers would be very helpful for promoting digital humanities to those who say they do not need big data for their research.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It feels like a ridiculous question to ask but here goes:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In the wake of Google Reader's demise I have been trying several other feed readers and it occurred to me that this might be a good time to review my current list of feeds with an eye to refreshing it (and introducing my students to the world of DH blogs). Time to get out of the old rut. Time to swing wide the floodgates and dive in to the whirlpool. Time to...stop with the cliched images...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, what say you DH Answer readers: what are your go to digital humanities/history blogs? Your must reads, your odd but compelling favorites, your &#34;what every young DH student should know&#34; blogs (or even tweeters for that matter)?&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This fall, I'm teaching a course called &#34;Literature of Information Overload.&#34; It's a 200-level undergraduate course in English. Students will mostly be sophomore English majors, I'd imagine.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I need help with selecting texts for this course! Below is a draft of the course description and a list of texts I've started (obviously I won't include all this on the syllabus, but I just wanted to give a sense of what I'm thinking). I'm looking for fiction, non-fiction, films -- you name it. Even if I don't use something in the syllabus, I'd like to compile a longer list of &#34;recommended reading and resources&#34; to post on the course website. &#60;strong&#62;I'm open to all ideas/suggestions.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
- - - -&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;em&#62;Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense. They listen so much that they forget to be natural. This is a nice story.&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/stein-atom-bomb.html&#34;&#62;Gertrude Stein, 1946&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Information overload is a contemporary cultural concern with a rich past. This course will cover a broad sampling of texts from different time periods to consider how our current confrontation/struggle with digital technologies both &#60;em&#62;is&#60;/em&#62; and &#60;em&#62;is not&#60;/em&#62; new. We will pay attention to the various forms that information overload takes: a pathological condition, a burden on attention and social bonds, a renaissance of knowledge access and production, and even a non-issue. Most importantly for our purposes, the texts we read and view will help us to ask how our understanding of knowledge, literature, and even ourselves evolves alongside technological innovations.  Through studying texts that comment on, represent, and/or actually produce the feeling of overload in readers, we will encounter questions like:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;How do people experience and describe information overload (or a sense of &#34;too much&#34;) across cultures and chapters of technological development? In what ways is the contemporary predicament of information management similar to and different from struggles of the past?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;How does information overload contribute to distraction and changing modes of attention, and why is this relevant to today's readers of literature? &#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;What are the differences between information and literature? What is at stake in efforts to make a distinction?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;If we accept the story of how humans are becoming increasingly dependent on their reference tools and technological devices, what new types of machine-human hybrids emerge? What reasons might we find for accepting or resisting this cyborg vision?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Through engaging with these questions and the texts (some alphabetic and others visual) on the syllabus, we will learn how information overload functions as a subject matter, a form or structuring device, and an affect generated by the work itself. This final affective quality of information overload (the feeling of having &#60;em&#62;too much&#60;/em&#62; to know and organize) is a familiar frenemy of college students, so I hope that you will draw on your personal experiences to enlighten our discussions and inform your writing.&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Are there any writings on the relationship between lexicography, discourse analysis, and text/data mining?  As I continue work on a keyword-specific project, I'm wondering where the theoretical, historical, and methodological overlaps are in these various ways of mapping epistemology through language.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are tons of questions one can ask between these fields, but I'm thinking in particular about whether something like the peaks and valleys in a frequency analysis constitute the rise and fall of a Foucauldian &#34;discursive regularity.&#34;  I recently saw &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/661645&#34;&#62;Bernard Geoghegan's piece in Critical Inquiry&#60;/a&#62; on enthusiasm for cybernetics research among French structuralists (a history he argues is important to visit in light of today's digital revolutions in the humanities), but it raises more questions than answers, wonderful as they are.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any leads would be much appreciated!
