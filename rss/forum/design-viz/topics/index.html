			<description>&#60;p&#62;A colleague of mine has been admiring the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.whatjanesaw.org/&#34;&#62;What Jane Saw&#60;/a&#62; project and has asked for help with an idea for a related immersive web-based gallery based on a historical model. I'm wondering if anyone can recommend similar sites that model gallery spaces or that use architectural models for site navigation and display. (And not Second Life.) There must be great architectural projects and museum sites out there that do this. Grateful for your suggestions.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We're also interested in suggestions for what kinds of platforms or software would be most useful for creating such a web-based project: making an architectural model, overlaying images, providing some kind of spatial navigation, etc. (It seems that What Jane Saw is built from SketchUp models, rendered into background images, and serving room and picture info with PHP and JavaScript.) What approaches would you recommend or avoid? Thanks for your time --
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What is the best set of questions that I could pose to a humanities scholar without any particular knowledge of computer technology to figure out what s/he is trying to do so that I design the best possible implementation in digital format?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(I've just written a &#60;a href=&#34;http://virtualgael.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/facilitating-digital-humanities-designs/&#34;&#62;blog post&#60;/a&#62; with some possible answers, which might be of interest to those trying to help humanities scholars design and plan digital projects. Perhaps others can offer further suggestions, comments or nuances here.)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm in discussions with a press about a second edition of a 100k word edition of an Old English poem. I'm pushing for an open, on-line release of the text with Print-on-Demand and ePub sales from the site. Since the introduction is frequently cited, and is available in part on Google Books already (ironically for a print-and-CD-ROM digital edition, Google just scanned the print copy), my argument is the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) People who are really in the market for a 100k word book on a 9-line poem are going to want to buy a copy in a format they can annotate, read off line, and that is generally more pleasing on the eye than a standard web-page (you'd be surprised how many people have wanted a copy in the last 8 years!)&#60;br /&#62;
2) People who are prepared to put up with poorer-quality, long-form presentation because they can get it for free on-line are basically already being lost to the Google Books site&#60;br /&#62;
3) Putting the whole argument and text out on the web will help keep the book central to debates in the field, presumably increasing the number of people buying copies under argument 1 above.&#60;br /&#62;
4) Reprinting a book+CD-ROM digital text today captures the worst of all worlds: we miss the exposure on-line publication provides via search engines and we lock the most flexible format (the digital) in a medium that is increasingly difficult to use and is certainly not multi-platform.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I can think of one somewhat parallel case that seems to show these arguments: Peter Baker's Introduction to Old English which, I am told, has sold very well through the years even though it has always been freely available on-line in a version that, if anything, is actually more feature-rich than the print copy. Does anybody know of any other examples?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some background: the edition was published in 2005 in a Print-and-CD-ROM, where the CD-ROM contained the full text of the print book and additional views, tools, and features. The edition itself has done better than you might think for a pretty long edition of a 9-line poem (I believe it sold through 3+ print runs) and it was runner up for MLA's best edition in 2007 (first medieval edition and I believe first digital to be so recognised). What I want to do now is publish a revised version of the contents of the CD-ROM to the web and offer POD copies and ePubs of the book content for sale from the site. My theory is that they are likely to sell for much the same reason the book sold in the first place: people use digital texts but given the choice they are still happy doing long-form reading in a format that is better suited to it that the browser.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any advice? Parallel examples? Other ideas?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello all,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm on the hunt for projects/tools/toolsets/good designs that are involved with the digital replication of texts, creating a range of ways to search, interact with, browse and investigate any text. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am based at the university of durham, and what we hope this will enable us to identify are new forms of digital curating and scholarly ‘good practice’.  Our aim is to be able to outline the important underlying principles for anyone interested in discovering and editing versions of physical texts as a digital entity.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone know of any technologies that we should incorporate into our research?... Or other similar projects / interesting people we should contact?... As part of a larger research we'd like to interview anyone involved with this kind of work - as a Curator, designer etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks terribly in advance.&#60;br /&#62;
Mariann

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're in the early planning stages of an initiative that will make available full text for some of our special collections library's manuscript holdings. We'll definitely provide a search interface, but we'd also like to allow the full text of these resources to be downloaded for researchers to use in text mining and whatever other applications suit their fancy. As a researcher doing this kind of work, what's the most useful way for us to make this full text available to you? One big download? Something else? Are there examples out there of sites that do this particularly well that we should model our capabilities after?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for your input!&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In surveying for existing web/mobile interfaces for digitized scrolls or scroll paintings, I'm mostly seeing fairly straightforward examples, interface-wise. I'm not finding many with rich annotation built in, for example, to say nothing of user-contributed content. Almost all are Flash-based enlargements with, in some cases, accompanying text and/or media. Strangely enough, I'm also finding very few of recent vintage. Are there any good examples out there of sophisticated UI/UX work with horizontal scrolls?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A handful of examples of what I'm finding:&#60;br /&#62;

&#60;a href=&#34;http://etcweb.princeton.edu/asianart/interactives/koetsu/scroll.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://etcweb.princeton.edu/asianart/interactives/koetsu/scroll.html&#60;/a&#62; (starting to get there)&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~icgzmod/qingming_student.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~icgzmod/qingming_student.html&#60;/a&#62; (closest I've found to what I would like to do)&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I intend to build a forum/community related to elder care.&#60;br /&#62;
The end users would typically use this as a support tool for QA, collaborate with others and also be able to link to various associated systems.&#60;br /&#62;
I did consider Drupal for the solution. Are there other options that I should be looking at?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, I am a Fulbright Scholar working on translation practice and theory. I'd like to solicit ideas for organizations that would support a multi-media presentation of the translations I am writing. Ideally, I would work with an organization that it invested in innovation in digital publishing, and the humanities.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Just throwing this out there for ideas--thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;[Since &#60;em&#62;DH Answers&#60;/em&#62; isn't really meant to be a jobs board, I'm exercising an admin's privilege and changing the title of this post to gear discussion more toward general advice. What should people like Brian be looking for, when seeking freelance help to execute DH projects? -- Ed.]&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hello,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm an independent scholar preparing a modern-spelling, heavily annotated edition of a 16th-century text. Eventually I hope to publish my edition in book form, but for various reasons I'd first like to make it available to subscribers online.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Can anyone recommend a freelance web designer/developer, familiar with subscription software, who could help me create a website for an electronic edition and make the content available to individual and institutional subscribers? Ideally he or she would be in New York City, but location isn't critical.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've worked out roughly how I'd like the site to look and function, but I don't have the skills to implement my ideas. And I'm even more clueless about subscription software.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The site will consist of about five small web pages, with a few paragraphs of copy and 5 or 10 captioned images on each page. These will provide a context for the original 60,000-word text (plus 100,000 words comprising my 1,000 substantive footnotes and 2,000 word glosses). The text won't be downloadable but only viewable by scrolling from page to page. If I can get the proper permission, I'd also like to include&#60;br /&#62;
facsimile pages from the original book, but this may be beyond my means right now.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Many thanks in advance for any recommendations,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Brian&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm interested in academic articles focusing on usability studies of digital humanities projects.  I would like to put together a list of projects and usability resources.  I am interested in usability methods used; more specifically I would like to examine questions from surveys, tasks required, average number of users sampled, intent of study, etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am happy to compose this resource and place it online if the community can start me on my way.  I've done basic Google Scholar searches with &#34;digital humanities&#34; and &#34;usability&#34; and have found a few older resources... I'm looking for current and past examples.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been talking to an art historian who wants to create a website that will map the influence of a particular body of works over time and space. Like: this work influenced that work, in this place, at this time. I'm having trouble picturing what this could look like, so I'm hoping you can point me to sites that do something like this in an interesting way.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is, I think, a design and interface question, not a data analysis question -- the art historian will create links among works using her own expertise, not large datasets.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks, as always!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm currently working on developing a model or concept for a online scholarly collection. I'm particularly interested in hearing from people in the DH community about possible models or best practices in this area. It'll help if I provide a little more context about the project's goals. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The author's 18/19th C. works are fairly varied and consist of texts in multiple editions &#38;amp; languages and draw heavily on natural science &#38;amp; anthropological collections. The overall aim of the digital collection is to offer a foundation for what in German is called &#34;rezeptionsgeschichtliche Forschung&#34; - that is to say, a scholarly edition in the service of tracking its intellectual reception. As such, the (i.e. our) digital collection should serve three goals:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;- electronic editions of the author's works&#60;br /&#62;
- critical commentary to the electronic editions&#60;br /&#62;
- temporal, formal, structural and content based contexts &#38;amp; parallels&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's a list of existing digital scholarly editions I've looked at so far which have proven to be valuable and interesting as potential models in this respect - some in some aspects, some in others (in no particular order):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Newton Project (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/&#60;/a&#62;)&#60;br /&#62;

&#60;p&#62;Are there any other sites you can recommend I look at? At present, we're thinking that the Darwin Correspondence Project and the Van Gogh Letters are probably closest in concept and presentation to what we had in mind. However I'm very interested in additional examples, especially those drawing on natural science and social science collections.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Second, with respect to formal guidelines, best practices and so forth I'm aware of the MLA Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly Editions (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_scholarly/cse_guidelines)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_scholarly/cse_guidelines)&#60;/a&#62;. Does anyone know of any other texts of this kind? I'm quite new to this area so it's more than likely I've missed something important I could be looking at as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;very many thanks in advance,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Arno&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;ps. I posted this under &#34;Interfaces, Design &#38;amp; Usability&#34; since this seemed closest to my question. Perhaps we should instead start a new DH Answers topic on Digital Editions?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is an instructional or logistical problem to solve for a planned online course on Human Computer Interaction, and we are looking for examples of other courses that are doing something similar, or best practice guidance from this community.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here is the problem:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The course will be designed to have 5 or 6 small teams of students in a 25 student course who create physical, tangible products (interface prototypes) as a central part of the course and need to exchange them with the other student groups, as well as the instructor, 3 different times over the course for usability testing and feedback.  Virtual simulations are not preferred, b/c it is deemed too involved to teach 3D modeling for this course and b/c the projects need to be touched to be evaluated.   &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So how to coordinate the production and sharing of a physical object among the group members who produce it (like in a bricks&#38;amp;mortar lab or studio), and then to produce multiple copies of each version of the prototype product to distribute to each student in other groups who could live anywhere on Earth, and specially package them so that each group opens them the same way and proper way so as not to invalidate their experience of using it.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What is involved to imagine doing this in a way that doesn't involve Fedex delivery and the costs involved?  3D Printing is not a real option yet either.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is mostly just a request for anyone with experience providing translations of DH projects to share what they learned. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some general questions: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;-How do the translations affect the workflow? i.e. if a change comes in for page (usually in English, in our case), what's the process to roll those changes out to the translated pages, especially if the original translator is no longer available?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;-How do you choose the languages to translate into?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;-What content do you translate? For instance, it is pretty easy to provide translations for the introductory pages, but if there is a lot of content it may be harder to provide translations for all of the content immediately. Is it worth rolling out translations for introductory pages before the translations for the content are complete?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm just starting research on this topic (beginning with the W3C's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech-lang/#ri20040808.100519373&#34;&#62;Internationalization Best Practices: Specifying Language in XHTML &#38;amp; HTML Content&#60;/a&#62;) but would love to hear other's experiences.  This isn't a question as much about the technical implementation, though I'd love to hear about that too if you want to share. :)
