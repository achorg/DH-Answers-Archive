			<description>&#60;p&#62;Photogrammetry is great for low-cost architectural/archaeological documentation, but for the type of virtual reality walkthrough exhibited by Williamsburg, the digital Pompeii project at the University of Arkansas, or any of the other projects using Unity, I'd recommend building the 3D models from scratch rather than importing models generated by photogrammetry.  Photogrammetry tends to produce a muddy, higher-polygon-than-necessary result.  It's great for documenting ruins, but not for reconstructions.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Paul,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is actually something I've been kicking for some time. I've had a lot of success modeling extant architecture with photogrammetry, and am a proponent of &#60;a href=&#34;http://ccwu.me/vsfm/&#34;&#62;VisualSfM&#60;/a&#62; (Noah Snavely who does &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/bundler/&#34;&#62;Bundler&#60;/a&#62; highly recommended it). I've also had good success getting models out of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan/standard/&#34;&#62;PhotoScan&#60;/a&#62;, which has a decent user interface for this type of thing. The benefit here is that you can get a textured model out of PhotoScan with a few clicks (and waiting), but you don't have to use additional modeling software to get generate a model. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've seen a lot of people use &#60;a href=&#34;http://unity3d.com/&#34;&#62;Unity&#60;/a&#62; to re-render this for web delivery. This is a technique used by Colonial Williamsburg for their &#60;a href=&#34;http://research.history.org/vw1776/&#34;&#62;Williamsburg 1776&#60;/a&#62; reconstruction of the town during the American Revolution. The down side to this technique (other than being quite resource intensive) is that it requires  a plugin to actually work. I think perhaps a better way to handle this is by leveraging modern browser's capabilities with webGL. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Depending on how &#34;good&#34; you want the render to be, you're going to need to clean the models up in something like 3DStudio Max, Maya, Blender, or any number of other modeling tools. Just a warning, though, if you're new to this kind of software, the learning curve is steep, and the interfaces for these tools take some getting use to.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For web delivery of the models using webGL, there are two main wrappers in major use these days, &#60;a href=&#34;http://threejs.org/&#34;&#62;three.js&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://kineticjs.com/&#34;&#62;kineticjs&#60;/a&#62; (there are others, but these seem to be getting the most traction). Using three.js, the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.chaostoperfection.com/&#34;&#62;Chaos to Perfection&#60;/a&#62; is an amazing interactive &#34;stroll&#34; around Versailles. And the project has an &#60;a href=&#34;http://threejs.org/&#34;&#62;amazing gallery&#60;/a&#62; of example work. For my own work, I've had quite a bit of success with three.js rendering high-poly models quite quickly, but the main issue I've run in to is the fact that a 30Mb texture map still takes a while to download...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For geospatial delivery, I've toyed with a plugin for Omeka that would allow you to add 3D models to items (with an eye toward using them with Neatline). I've been holding off a bit as OpenLayers (the library we use for rendering maps) is going through a major upgrade that will allow you to &#34;easily&#34; tie &#60;a href=&#34;http://cesium.agi.com/&#34;&#62;cesium&#60;/a&#62; to the map, allow you to render terrains (and hopefully models) in 3D without a plugin. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With all that said, here are some other examples of using 3D to help visualize this kind of data:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://mayaarch3d.unm.edu/&#34;&#62;MayaArch&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.kvl.cch.kcl.ac.uk/projects.html&#34;&#62;King's Visualization Lab&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://archive.cyark.org/&#34;&#62;CyArk&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://idialab.org/&#34;&#62;IDIALab&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.byzantium1200.com/index.html&#34;&#62;Byzantium 1200&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dukewired.org/&#34;&#62;Duke Wired&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And, if you're not prone to motion sickness, this is a visualization of 10,000+ images I did of a Spanish Monastery that steps through each image, showing a point cloud, and its shaded and textured surfaces. &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pKOtiQ-ZOI&#34;&#62;Calatrava&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;HTH,&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A colleague of mine has been admiring the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.whatjanesaw.org/&#34;&#62;What Jane Saw&#60;/a&#62; project and has asked for help with an idea for a related immersive web-based gallery based on a historical model. I'm wondering if anyone can recommend similar sites that model gallery spaces or that use architectural models for site navigation and display. (And not Second Life.) There must be great architectural projects and museum sites out there that do this. Grateful for your suggestions.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We're also interested in suggestions for what kinds of platforms or software would be most useful for creating such a web-based project: making an architectural model, overlaying images, providing some kind of spatial navigation, etc. (It seems that What Jane Saw is built from SketchUp models, rendered into background images, and serving room and picture info with PHP and JavaScript.) What approaches would you recommend or avoid? Thanks for your time --
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Those are great questions. I particularly like #6 and #8 as a way to help refine the define. I agree with Willy Lee that one way to help focus is to get at the difference between a collection, a Collection, a collection with narrative, and a typical web site. I've found that people who do not have a background in building collections don't usually distinguish between collection=a bunch of stuff I want to organize and display, and Collection=a curated group of objects chosen according to specific criteria. Neither do they distinguish between collections and exhibits. Showing them a searchable/browsable database of objects (eg dSpace), then showing a narrated exhibit (with the objects still in a searchable database behind the exhibit, eg Omeka) goes a long way to clearing that confusion up. (And then too often you find out what they really want is a customized web site with all kinds of bells and whistles. *sigh*)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With question #6 you will be able to find out if they want to do things 'above and beyond' that will require additional apps, all of which should play nicely with your core application, so that helps determine what you need as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for posting the questions--I'm going to use the pedagogical ones to help frame a course project we are designing right now!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Is this a story/narrative or a collection/database?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is one of the things I always try to pin down first. If the project has to be in a singular narrative path, it makes some tools completely inappropriate. Alternatively, many tools that excel at narratives are poor choices for random browsing.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What is the best set of questions that I could pose to a humanities scholar without any particular knowledge of computer technology to figure out what s/he is trying to do so that I design the best possible implementation in digital format?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(I've just written a &#60;a href=&#34;http://virtualgael.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/facilitating-digital-humanities-designs/&#34;&#62;blog post&#60;/a&#62; with some possible answers, which might be of interest to those trying to help humanities scholars design and plan digital projects. Perhaps others can offer further suggestions, comments or nuances here.)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Dan,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The &#34;freemium&#34; business model, when applied to publishing, often works out the way you describe: a version of the work is freely available to read online, perhaps even under a Creative Commons or other open license, but more convenient versions (like ebooks and print versions) are available for purchase.  Some titles in OpenEdition and OAPEN are available this way, and DOAB points to many others.  We use this model for titles published under the digitalculturebooks imprint: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalculture.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.digitalculture.org/&#60;/a&#62; , and Utah State University Press makes titles available in HathiTrust ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?a=listis;c=869533047&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?a=listis;c=869533047&#60;/a&#62; ), with the full view including a &#34;buy a copy&#34; link.  For others, see:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* &#60;a href=&#34;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Dual-edition_publishing&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Dual-edition_publishing&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
* &#60;a href=&#34;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Tiered_quality&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Tiered_quality&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for open content selling well, some evidence has shown that it has helped sales, while others see no impact on sales.  We at Michigan are unaware of any evidence that it hurts sales; our digitalculturebooks titles are among the University of Michigan Press titles that sell best despite being freely available to read online.  For more, see:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=(&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.google.com/search?q=(&#60;/a&#62;&#34;open+access&#34;+OR+OA)+effect+sales&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In case it helps, here's an example of supplementary material that was never included in the print edition of the book (even as a CD-ROM):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/r/ramsey/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/r/ramsey/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;By the way, if I were Google, I would also accept only paper, PDF/A-1b, or PDF/A-2b as input.  There are fewer variables on input (like page size and the number of colors per page) than if you start accepting people's digital files.  It's kind of like how Google only wants to crawl webpages and PDFs: you can offer them all sorts of structured metadata, but they're just going to use their standard algorithms anyway.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;—Kevin

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm in discussions with a press about a second edition of a 100k word edition of an Old English poem. I'm pushing for an open, on-line release of the text with Print-on-Demand and ePub sales from the site. Since the introduction is frequently cited, and is available in part on Google Books already (ironically for a print-and-CD-ROM digital edition, Google just scanned the print copy), my argument is the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) People who are really in the market for a 100k word book on a 9-line poem are going to want to buy a copy in a format they can annotate, read off line, and that is generally more pleasing on the eye than a standard web-page (you'd be surprised how many people have wanted a copy in the last 8 years!)&#60;br /&#62;
2) People who are prepared to put up with poorer-quality, long-form presentation because they can get it for free on-line are basically already being lost to the Google Books site&#60;br /&#62;
3) Putting the whole argument and text out on the web will help keep the book central to debates in the field, presumably increasing the number of people buying copies under argument 1 above.&#60;br /&#62;
4) Reprinting a book+CD-ROM digital text today captures the worst of all worlds: we miss the exposure on-line publication provides via search engines and we lock the most flexible format (the digital) in a medium that is increasingly difficult to use and is certainly not multi-platform.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I can think of one somewhat parallel case that seems to show these arguments: Peter Baker's Introduction to Old English which, I am told, has sold very well through the years even though it has always been freely available on-line in a version that, if anything, is actually more feature-rich than the print copy. Does anybody know of any other examples?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some background: the edition was published in 2005 in a Print-and-CD-ROM, where the CD-ROM contained the full text of the print book and additional views, tools, and features. The edition itself has done better than you might think for a pretty long edition of a 9-line poem (I believe it sold through 3+ print runs) and it was runner up for MLA's best edition in 2007 (first medieval edition and I believe first digital to be so recognised). What I want to do now is publish a revised version of the contents of the CD-ROM to the web and offer POD copies and ePubs of the book content for sale from the site. My theory is that they are likely to sell for much the same reason the book sold in the first place: people use digital texts but given the choice they are still happy doing long-form reading in a format that is better suited to it that the browser.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any advice? Parallel examples? Other ideas?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello all,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm on the hunt for projects/tools/toolsets/good designs that are involved with the digital replication of texts, creating a range of ways to search, interact with, browse and investigate any text. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am based at the university of durham, and what we hope this will enable us to identify are new forms of digital curating and scholarly ‘good practice’.  Our aim is to be able to outline the important underlying principles for anyone interested in discovering and editing versions of physical texts as a digital entity.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone know of any technologies that we should incorporate into our research?... Or other similar projects / interesting people we should contact?... As part of a larger research we'd like to interview anyone involved with this kind of work - as a Curator, designer etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks terribly in advance.&#60;br /&#62;
Mariann

&#60;p&#62;My model repository would be &#60;a href=&#34;http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/&#34;&#62;Chronicling America;&#60;/a&#62; the Library of Congress did a very nice job assembling linked open data on a hierarchical set, and (now) allowing updated downloads of the full corpus. And it's possible to just pull one article at a time without any fuss—anything that creates a low barrier to entry (using JSON as well as XML for metadata, for example) helps. Plus they have a nice suits of additional APIs (for snipped image data, for example)—obviously a smaller project won't want to do all of them, but some might be available.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm a fan of HathiTrust's system. They have .zip files for each volume, with pages stored as separate .txt files within the zip. Then they have metadata for each volume as a .json object. Multiple volumes that are part of the same &#34;work&#34; (or I suppose, ms collection) can be linked via a record id.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;All of this is available (as copyright permits) via an API.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Of course, this system would require some adaptation to apply to mss. But I'm mentioning HathiTrust as an example because I think it's going to be valuable in the long run to aim for &#60;em&#62;some&#60;/em&#62; kind of consistency across repositories.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're in the early planning stages of an initiative that will make available full text for some of our special collections library's manuscript holdings. We'll definitely provide a search interface, but we'd also like to allow the full text of these resources to be downloaded for researchers to use in text mining and whatever other applications suit their fancy. As a researcher doing this kind of work, what's the most useful way for us to make this full text available to you? One big download? Something else? Are there examples out there of sites that do this particularly well that we should model our capabilities after?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for your input!&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Greetings visitors from ProfHacker! In noticing that this thread was linked today, I realized I hadn't updated it with where I'm at with this project.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One of &#60;a href=&#34;http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/links/&#34;&#62;the examples at the IIPImage site&#60;/a&#62; was of work done at the National Gallery (London), especially by Joseph Padfield. After some consultation with him, I'm using his implementation of IIPImage for project's current phase. (Though he and they have put out there &#60;a href=&#34;http://research.ng-london.org.uk/wiki/index.php/National_Gallery_IIPImage&#34;&#62;a number of examples of using interesting customizations of IIPImage&#60;/a&#62;, I'm focusing on the annotation, remote image, and comparison features.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Since IIPImage started working for me reasonably well, I haven't examined Luna.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I intend to build a forum/community related to elder care.&#60;br /&#62;
The end users would typically use this as a support tool for QA, collaborate with others and also be able to link to various associated systems.&#60;br /&#62;
I did consider Drupal for the solution. Are there other options that I should be looking at?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
