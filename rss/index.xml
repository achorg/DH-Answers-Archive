			<description>&#60;p&#62;Some of the pieces of my &#60;a href=&#34;http://dr.amandavisconti.com/&#34;&#62;(completed) digital dissertation&#60;/a&#62; using web design/development for literature scholarship might be useful? Some specific links below, but also check out &#60;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qJwx0nYam3aJazetVfmij6q92Owv-gu_pfl-Xci6BLM/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&#62;this great GoogleDoc&#60;/a&#62; some folks at CUNY curated with info on a variety of digital dissertation formats.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&#34;&#62;some blog posts&#60;/a&#62; both about the design of a digital edition website for my dissertation, and about the design of the websites presenting the dissertation (e.g. &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/04/02/digitaldissformat&#34;&#62;post on choosing and arguing for digital dissertation design&#60;/a&#62;, and &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/03/31/html5scholarlyarticle&#34;&#62;some design choices&#60;/a&#62;, and &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/09/16/user-testing-a-digital-edition-getting-the-feedback-you-need&#34;&#62;user testing dissertation websites&#60;/a&#62;). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A skim of the table of contents for &#60;a href=&#34;http://dr.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf&#34;&#62;the whitepaper debriefing my digital dissertation&#60;/a&#62; might also be useful?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I also found it useful to &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-dissertation/blob/master/About%20the%20Dissertation/MANIFEST.md&#34;&#62;make a list of all the scholarly effort that went into the digital dissertation&#60;/a&#62;, annotated to explain the website-related work that might not be obvious to scholarly evaluators.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, I agree with you in many ways. There is unarguably a huge generation gap. Clearly there was no internet when I finished college in the early 90's.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My 9 year old daughter hardly keeps the smart phone down. She keeps fiddling with it after school, playing one those online kid games. As a father, I am unable to say no. I allow her to play a couple of hours nevertheless fearing that she would be left behind in a world where everyone is so information savvy and so ingrained in the digital culture. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I do not know if I am doing the right thing.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Your prescriptions for managing distraction are good but may not work for everybody. As you rightly said it depends on one's profession and livelihood. Working in a corporate world and some times on virtual mode it becomes utmost necessity to be on top of things. It's a race, lest you are not in the good books of your boss. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Meditative or not I think it works when you take it (Information) as it comes and not voluntarily be too hungry to seek it unless there is a dire need. Just keep the intention alive and look around. It works. For me honestly, only in spurts!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I listen to NPR, fresh air once in a while.Your words at the very end were good. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;Snowflakes are falling in abundance outside my window. I paused while drafting this answer to watch them. &#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Cheers, Ramkumar

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I in general think that answer to this question differs for scholars and for general public. In order to do scholarship, which for me are activities of writing, reading, transcribing, researching, encoding and formatting texts, it takes hours of uninterrupted time. To be productive, I resort to several practices which in our era of information overload seem almost like monkish or meditative, including the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) No smartphone. Never bought one, originally because expensive, later because decided it was a time sink and source of interruptions. Not having one has mostly eliminated the sleep problem.&#60;br /&#62;
2) Limit social network usage to minimum (no Facebook, never signed up; did use Twitter several years, now mostly in hiatus)&#60;br /&#62;
3) Anti-distraction software on desktop (Macintosh SelfControl, which blocks access to time-wasting web sites)&#60;br /&#62;
4) No 24-hour TV news (no cable)&#60;br /&#62;
5) Over time cultivated and developed preference for austere and regimented software interaction, plain text with RegEx manipulation, LaTeX, well-formedness and validity in XML, citation keys with Zotero, etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Sustained scholarly engagement demands immense rigor. And I usually fall short of what I would hope, but the choices and habits above allow me to not feel particularly overwhelmed by digital culture. These obviously cannot be adopted by everyone. I'm past middle-age and long-time partnered, so I have no urgency to keep up with youth culture or to date. A public or activist scholarship would likely be unable to restrict itself to such methods. And I wonder how a scholar of gaming culture can resist the allure of just playing games. But over time I've satisfied myself that being aware of the daily political news or sports or cultural events lacks the urgency that I once felt toward it.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I was  influenced by listening to a scholar on NPR several years ago, perhaps on FreshAir. An eminent, productive scholar, she described limiting her access to the news so she could concentrate on her work One day her mother (the scholar's mother) wanted to talk about the fall of the Berlin Wall. And the scholar had to explain to her mother that she did not know that the Berlin Wall had &#34;fallen&#34; several days before--because she had restricted her consumption of the news. Her mother said something like, &#34;I don't want to talk to anyone who does not even know about the fall of the Berlin wall,&#34; and hung up the phone. The scholar, at first in some consternation because her mother had hung up on her, resigned herself to her choice, though she protested to the radio audience that she usually learned about major events within a week or two (i.e., her mother had told her),  and remained sufficiently informed about the present. I wish I could recall the scholar's name, but her attitude seemed immensely sane to me. And I cut back on news consumption after hearing that interview. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't think it's easy to draw line, but I do think it's possible and necessary to cultivate habits of information interaction that reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed, for scholars and the general public.  In my case, to concentrate on scholarship, it feels like I have to draw the lines with a degree of rigor that to the general public and my students seems excessive. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Snowflakes are falling in abundance outside my window. I paused while drafting this answer to watch them. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Best, Wesley

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;br /&#62;
We are frequently overwhelmed with digital information. We do not switch off our smart phones and devices till late in the night this disturbs our sleep and on top of it, there is enough distraction at work during the day. How do we deal with this ?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have personally seen many people on social networks having an emotional breakdown and have gone into depression either due the over-exposure or their ideas and posts not being paid attention to.  They are unable to deal with this exposure and overload of information. As a society, are we going too fast on the information super lane? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We are not paying enough attention. Human attention span on any piece of useful information is only about 3-4 minutes and beyond this is distraction. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;How do we practice being selective and where do we draw the line ? are the other things that come to my mind right now.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you have thoughts or comments please do share. Would greatly appreciate. Cheers, Ramkumar

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am looking for more examples to explain the 'small world' network phenomenon.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am working on an article on the same. An example which I have taken up is - a modern well connected cluster of villages. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Smart and digitally enabled cluster of villages with urban and social infrastructure are the way forward. In such clusters, every body is connected to everybody. Information passes through all them seamlessly. Everybody stays informed and there are numerous advantages from eliminating village feuds to sharing farm practices and social welfare schemes. Similarly, there could be others. Cheers, Ramkumar

			<description>&#60;p&#62;That sounds like a great activity! I've always wanted to do more with this. Ryan Cordell describes some of his teaching exercises in hand-setting type in &#34;Programmable Type: &#60;a href=&#34;http://ryancordell.org/research/programmabletype/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://ryancordell.org/research/programmabletype/&#60;/a&#62; &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Personally have had fun with the online &#34;shape type&#34; game &#60;a href=&#34;http://shape.method.ac/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://shape.method.ac/&#60;/a&#62; and the kerning game: &#60;a href=&#34;http://type.method.ac/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://type.method.ac/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Do you have classroom activities, exercises, and lesson plans about typography (font selection, typesetting, etc.)? I have used one activity for years -- it involves taking a serious or playful text and typesetting it (in InDesign) to look the opposite (for example, making a &#60;em&#62;People Magazine&#60;/em&#62; or &#60;em&#62;Buzzfeed&#60;/em&#62; article look like an article in &#60;em&#62;Harper's Bazaar&#60;/em&#62; or &#60;em&#62;The New York Times&#60;/em&#62;). I think this idea came from Johanna Drucker but I cannot find the source right now! Some takeaways from the activity are that typographic styles are rhetorical and even small changes make a big difference. At any rate, I would love more ideas for how to teach typography in any college setting / course.

&#60;p&#62;Thanks Justin. DiscoverText (&#60;a href=&#34;https://discovertext.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://discovertext.com&#60;/a&#62;) is an option for day-forward Twitter via the Search API or using the Gnip PowerTrack. For historical Twitter, people need to use Sifter (&#60;a href=&#34;https://sifter.texifter.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://sifter.texifter.com&#60;/a&#62;) to generate up to three free estimates per day. If there is an estimate you like, there is a price to access the data using DiscoverText.

&#60;p&#62;The Twitter API supports retrieving the last 3,200 tweets from a user's timeline. A commandline tool like Twarc (&#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docnow/twarc&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/docnow/twarc&#60;/a&#62;) can be used to get the user's timeline from the API. If you're looking for web interface, Social Feed Manager (&#60;a href=&#34;https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/)&#60;/a&#62;, which I work on, is another option.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Options for getting historical tweets for a hashtag are much more limited. The Search API only indexes the last 7-9 days. The search on Twitter's website indexes further back in time, but the nature of what is indexed (and not indexed) is unknown.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Data service providers such as DiscoverText (&#60;a href=&#34;https://discovertext.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://discovertext.com/&#60;/a&#62;) allow for greater access to historical data, but obviously at a cost.

&#60;p&#62;I see that it is possible to use Twitter's Advanced Search to search for a particular account's tweets during a given time period; however, that requires scrolling through it all on their site. What would be best is the ability to export them (links, images, and all).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I would like to capture tweets from last year which centered on a particular social movement in Kenya. Many of them were sent or retweeted by @ConsumersKenya, so simply getting an archive of their tweets within a certain timeframe would be quite helpful. Being able to get those who used relevant hashtags during that period would also be fruitful.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There seem to be plenty of services to archive ongoing tweets, but is there a good way to get historical tweets for certain dates?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I just saw that this topic had been revived, and I thought I'd point out that &#60;a href=&#34;http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/&#34;&#62;Lexos&#60;/a&#62; enables the user to strip tags selectively customising how each tag is handled. This can be really useful if, for example, you want to keep readings in &#60;code&#62;&#38;lt;orig&#38;gt;&#60;/code&#62; and delete readings in &#60;code&#62;&#38;lt;reg&#38;gt;&#60;/code&#62;. We haven't tested it with large numbers of files, but you can always do your processing in small batches if it gets too slow.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is an older post, so it's probably not worth offering many more solutions, but I want to mention that some simple document conversion, including TEI, is available through Voyant.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You would create a Voyant corpus as usual (say a zip file with TEI documents):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/corpuscreator&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://voyant-tools.org/docs/#&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://voyant-tools.org/docs/#&#60;/a&#62;!/guide/corpuscreator&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And then you could use the Documents tool (middle tab in the lower left-hand panel of the default skin) to download the corpus in one or more formats (original, minimal HTML for Voyant, plain text):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/documents&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://voyant-tools.org/docs/#&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://voyant-tools.org/docs/#&#60;/a&#62;!/guide/documents&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There's also the MLA's &#60;a href='https://www.mla.org/About-Us/Governance/Committees/Committee-Listings/Professional-Issues/Committee-on-Information-Technology/Guidelines-for-Evaluating-Work-in-Digital-Humanities-and-Digital-Media'&#62;Guide for evaluating DH work&#60;/a&#62;. It's (sadly) less about grad students than tenure and promotion, but seems to still apply. If nothing else, the fact that MLA (and AHA, for that matter) have produced guides for DH evaluation says clearly that the professional organization says that DH does, in fact, correlate with language, literature, and teaching.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;(We tweeted a bit, but for anyone else happening on this question...)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;DH dissertations in general&#60;br /&#62;
-----&#60;br /&#62;
1. The CUNY Graduate Center fellows and staff do amazing work making more kinds of dissertation possible, and in particular I'd suggest looking for blog posts and video from their #remixthediss event/project (e.g. &#60;a href=&#34;http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/pieces/what-dissertation-new-models-methods-media)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/pieces/what-dissertation-new-models-methods-media)&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2. They maintain a collaborative GoogleDoc where people doing current or past non-monograph dissertations (humanities and not, digital and not) describe and link to their projects: &#60;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/remixthediss-models&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://bit.ly/remixthediss-models&#60;/a&#62;. I don't think these are included there, but two additional completed DH+textual literature dissertations to check out or use as examples are:&#60;br /&#62;
* Lisa Rhody's literature dissertation using topic modeling and visualization to explore ekphrastic poetry: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lisarhody.com/project/revising-ekphrasis/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.lisarhody.com/project/revising-ekphrasis/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
* Tanya Clement's literature dissertation included the creation of an experimental scholarly digital edition: &#60;a href=&#34;http://digital.lib.umd.edu/transition/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digital.lib.umd.edu/transition/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;3. Here's a Zotero library of articles and guidelines for doing DH dissertations and applying for DH promotion/tenure (the latter often being applicable to arguing for the former): &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/amandavisconti/items/collectionKey/V9DA47T7&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.zotero.org/amandavisconti/items/collectionKey/V9DA47T7&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My DH+textual studies dissertation&#60;br /&#62;
-----&#60;br /&#62;
I defended a DH dissertation about public digital humanities and digital textual scholarship for the University of Maryland's literature Ph.D. To show the department chair what a completed DH+textual studies dissertation can look like, or reuse some of the DH and literature precedents I used in my arguments:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The dissertation did not include any chapters; I used design, code, usertesting, blogging, and an analytical report written during last month before defense.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The completed dissertation is this website: &#60;a href=&#34;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dr.amandavisconti.com&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The dissertation produced a participatory digital edition of Ulysses (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.infiniteulysses.com)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.infiniteulysses.com)&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My doctoral exams areas were DH and textual scholarship (list and introductory essay explaining choices here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/assets/ExamsSharingCopy.pdf)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/assets/ExamsSharingCopy.pdf)&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I blogged about twice a month through exams and the dissertation, both about my research and the larger meta aspects of doing a digital/DH dissertation: &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&#60;/a&#62;. In particular, this post has some practical advice on getting started (&#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation&#60;/a&#62;) and this post has info on choosing your dissertation's format (&#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/04/02/digitaldissformat)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/04/02/digitaldissformat)&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The slides and text of my successful dissertation defense talk are here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/20/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/06/20/digital-humanities-dissertation-defense-talk&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am happy to email with this student (or anyone curious about DH/digital dissertations!) via &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:amandavisconti@gmail.com&#34;&#62;amandavisconti@gmail.com&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone: I have a former grad student who wrote to me in a panic. Apparently, her current department chair has decided that her previous coursework in DH, book history will not count towards her current graduate program, because it does not &#34;correlate&#34; to literature, composition, or teaching. (Wow. I can barely even.) The chair is apparently reacting to an accreditation review and has asked for justification in language accessible to non-specialist peers. Does anyone have go-to resources for helping us make this case? Thank you --

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have the chance to get a 3D scanner alongside a 3D printer for a DH-lab-to-be, and although there's lots of useful posts here about 3D printers, there doesn't seem to be much about 3D scanners. If anyone has any recommendations or tips, I'd be glad to hear them. It's not going to be state-of-the-art stuff (yet), but there's a lot of scope for interesting work with colleagues at my institution working on digital cultural heritage so I'd like to get something that will at least provide the opportunity for people to pilot ideas or create a proof of concept.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is the answer I got from Scalar:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We've thought about including this kind of functionality as a built-in feature in Scalar before, allowing authors to insert multiple media objects side-by-side. Perhaps down the road we will. For now, this sort of thing must be done manually, using html in the html editor. In other words, when you're in the page editor, click &#34;Source&#34; so that you're editing the actual html, then insert your media manually, spacing them side-by-side accordingly.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd be very grateful if someone gave me the html code to do this.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working with scalar (&#60;a href=&#34;http://scalar.usc.edu&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://scalar.usc.edu&#60;/a&#62;) and would like to compare pictures and transcriptions in columns. I guess three and even four columns of pictures or transcriptions should be possible. Many thanks for your help.&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much. That post's question seems very similar to mine indeed! I'm just now looking into the replies you've directed me to via CODE4LIB in LISTSERV.  (I had to register first.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One reply mentions Zotero, which some of the above posts suggest. The other replies seem related to library cataloguing purposes and are pretty technical in nature. But I am keeping an open mind.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far I've been doing some practice conversion of my printed entries into Zotero in Firefox. I will be reading up on Drupal, exploring Drupal's Biblio Zotero plug in, etc., as suggested above.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Still open to further suggestions, however.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've just applied for funding this project. Outcome will not be until December. So I expect to be researching possibilities further and, as I say, still welcome further suggestions. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[Update: the link to my website in my first post is no longer active; the archived link is &#60;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20131209052925/http://susanhollismerritt.org/index.html&#34;&#62;susanhollismerritt.org&#60;/a&#62;.]
