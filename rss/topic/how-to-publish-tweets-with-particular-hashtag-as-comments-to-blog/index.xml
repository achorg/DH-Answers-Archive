			<description>&#60;p&#62;As far as I know, what you're asking might be stretching the possibilities for Posterous or Wordpress. Your best bet might be to create the blog post and use a widget to compile the tweets on the sidebar. Not the best method, but should still get your point across. Other than that, you could always archive the tweets using TwapperKeeper or something similar, and then add select ones to the blog post later. Some WP themes will automatically link out to all Tweets mentioning a post, depending on how the link is passed around. Good luck.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm planning to organise a web-based Q&#38;amp;A session for a poster I am going to present at a conference I will probably not be able to attend.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I was thinking to give a twitter hashtag to add to questions as to be able to track them more easily, but I do not want to limit my self to tweeps. I thought thus to prepare also a blog post about the poster and answer to comments as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What I really would like to know is if there is a way to move then automatically all these comments and tweets to only one page for future reference to the discussion. Is there a way to publish tweets with a particular hashtag as comments to wordpress/posterous blogposts? Or to merge comments and tags into a 3rd page?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
