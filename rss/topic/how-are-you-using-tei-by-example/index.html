			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've used it with my iSchool students too. The thing we need right now, though, are sample TEI documents to download to test out some tools. Is it possible to have that on TEI by Example? Free, downloadable, collections of TEI texts that are valid? I will probably put up a question that asks the same . . .
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;thanks Michelle, I think we're interested in finding that out. Sure, I can do a link analysis and find out who is linking back to us, but I was wondering how people are embedding it in their teaching. Interested to hear....

&#60;p&#62;This is exactly what I was hoping to get from this kind of discussion, thanks Mark. We are thinking &#34;what next&#34;, so I think you are on to something there. I cant promise it will happen anytime soon, but thanks, got me thinking...

			<description>&#60;p&#62;TEI by Example is a wonderful resource.  While I have never used it directly in a workshop on TEI, I invariably refer people to it, and have consulted it on occasion myself as needed.  So, well done!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On the principle that no good deed should go unpunished, however, it would be great to see it expanded a bit.  In particular, a section on transformations, or on using the TEI stylesheet templates, would be a terrific addition. This stage in the process of text encoding remains, I think, the greatest bottleneck to new users.  TEI XML is not particularly complicated and is easy to teach; XSLT, on the other hand, can be very difficult, and the TEI stylesheets are not presented in a particularly &#34;user-friendly&#34; way.  It would be enormously beneficial to TEI noobies to have a resource that answered the inevitable question:  &#34;Ok, I have a tagged text.  NOW what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In any case, as I say, well done!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Following on Bethany's post, I too plan to use the module on parallel segmentation to help me with a new project on the horizon, but I should also say that your post serves as a kick in the butt for me to update the training modules I have in place for my e-text interns.  Currently I use a crazy concoction of resources with a paired down version of Julia's and Syd's Intensive TEI Workshop as the focus (thank goodness for that) and have been meaning to transition to TEI by Example.  So, no real tales of use, just intended use, but I see great potential for TEI by Example as a training foundation for our interns and graduate assistants.  Once I get organized, at our shop, 5-10 interns/GAs a year will benefit from it.  I shall have more to say about it later, for sure.  Stay tuned.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Have others formally integrated TEI by Example in a course or as part of training workshops?  If so, are you willing to share syllabi or training documentation?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, Melissa -- I used it just last week and was very glad to have it! It's been a while since I've done any TEI markup, and I had never created a parallel segmented apparatus, so needed a refresher course. Along the way, I realized how useful it could be for my Rare Book School students, so will be recommending it. Thanks to all of you who contributed to such a fantastic resource! -- Bethany

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I used it on my own when I got started with TEI. I found it useful as an introduction to TEI, but never used it again since then.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I use it for demos of XML in introductory library-school classes, because students find it easier to assimilate than (say) a typical metadata schema. I'd like to go deeper, but at the moment I'm not teaching the right courses for that!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Folks&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd like to know a little more about how the DH community is using TEI by Example (&#60;a href=&#34;http://tbe.kantl.be/TBE/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://tbe.kantl.be/TBE/)&#60;/a&#62;. Have you used it as an individual, or in a class, or in a workshop, or That Camp? Could you sum up in a sentence or two how, where, and when you have found it useful?&#60;br /&#62;
best&#60;br /&#62;
Melissa
