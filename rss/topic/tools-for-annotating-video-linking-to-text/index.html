			<description>&#60;p&#62;I did something a bit like this on a Faulkner audio digitization project in the Scholars' Lab. We used TEI as the transcription encoding format. TEI does provide for timestamp information, so I think you can build a system on top of the TEI files to overlay the annotations on the video at the correct moment and in the correct place, with HTML5 and some javascript. This looks promising: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.openvideoannotation.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.openvideoannotation.org/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/profile/hopegreenberg'&#62;hopegreenberg&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/tools-for-annotating-video-linking-to-text#post-2187&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hi Hope â€” here are just a couple of thoughts, though there may well be other options: &#60;a href=&#34;http://scalar.usc.edu/&#34;&#62;Scalar&#60;/a&#62; has good multimedia annotation capabilities, and you can also annotate video with &#60;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/using-video-annotation-tools-to-teach-film-analysis/57171&#34;&#62;Social Book&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clipnotes/id565021402?mt=8&#34;&#62;Clip Notes&#60;/a&#62;. It also occurs to me that &#60;a href=&#34;https://mozillalabs.com/en-US/Popcorn/&#34;&#62;Mozilla Popcorn&#60;/a&#62; could be a useful tool for this.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't immediately know of a way to hop from a video to a text and back again, except with Scalar. It &#60;em&#62;seems&#60;/em&#62; like it should be possible, though.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We have a project that contains documents originally created in Word (with a PDF version, though we could certainly make an HTML version as well) and videos created using Camtasia. The documents are scripts that describe or expand upon the content delivered in the video. We would like to annotate the videos such that they contain a marker/hot spot/chunk of text that is a link to the appropriate place in the document. Also, it would be nice to put a marker in the document that connects to a specific spot in the video. It would be even sweeter to use Word's indexing feature to create an index (not hard) that contains links to both video and document (harder).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, does any of this sound familiar? Are there existing tools that might help? Camtasia has a &#34;hot spot' feature that can link to a URL (I'll have to see if it can link to an anchor within a page), Word can include hypertext links, so I can sort of cobble this together but I was hoping there was a video annotation tool out there that would streamline this.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
