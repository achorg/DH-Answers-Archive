			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Cathy - &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We hope that the Master's in Knowledge &#38;amp; Networks draft proposal gets some great feedback at &#60;a href=&#34;http://hastacblogs.org/duke/makn/&#34;&#62;http://hastacblogs.org/duke/makn/&#60;/a&#62;.  To that end, we're closing the topic here so as not to have people's thoughts in multiple places. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;At DHAnswers we're really trying to remain focused on specific questions that produce clear answers, or in the case of more pedagogically-oriented questions, that produce specific processes/procedures/assignments to try in the classroom.  We're trying to avoid the types of posts that specifically point people elsewhere.   If there's something you or anyone else wants to get the word out about, Twitter is definitely the quickest and best way to do that, and posts on the Humanist email list are highly effective, too.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, thread-readers, to comment on Duke's proposed Master's in Knowledge and Networks, go to &#60;a href=&#34;http://hastacblogs.org/duke/makn/&#34;&#62;http://hastacblogs.org/duke/makn/&#60;/a&#62;.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear colleagues, Duke University asked me and HASTAC to propose a visionary new kind of &#34;re-professional&#34; Master's degree for a digital age and we came up with this Master's in Knowledge and Networks.   It combines profound humanistic knowledge, history, and theory with technology skills, project management, business planning, and practical experience working in community organizations, learning organizations, and local (or international) businesses, actually or, in some cases,virtually.   We are basing this at Duke but hope to have partners all over the world and hope that this idea spurs others to rethink the boundaries of the two cultures, of town and gown, of theory and practice, of humanism and practical job preparedness in a changing information ecosystem.   We've posted the entire proposal on Comment Press and would welcome feedback from the Digital Humanities community.  Here's the url:  &#60;a href=&#34;http://hastacblogs.org/duke/makn/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://hastacblogs.org/duke/makn/&#60;/a&#62;      Thank you very much, Cathy Davidson
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
