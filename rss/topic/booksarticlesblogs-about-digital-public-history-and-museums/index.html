			<description>&#60;p&#62;That's great to know, Richard--thanks for the update. Good luck with the LT issue--I'm looking forward to it.  At the risk of taking this too far outside the specific PH/DH question, I'd wager &#34;[t]he three&#34; that you mentioned are the special issues related to LAM (library/archive/museum, for those that may not know) convergence from &#60;em&#62;Archival Science&#60;/em&#62;, &#60;em&#62;Museum Management and Curatorship&#60;/em&#62;, and &#60;em&#62;Library Quarterly&#60;/em&#62;.  For those that are interested, here is a brief summary of that project here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://hangingtogether.org/?p=757&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://hangingtogether.org/?p=757&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Ed,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm guessing (as one of the co-editors) that the LT issue probably won't be out until next year. There are also the three.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If I have time later this month, I'll try to troll through my Zotero library to pick out some things that seem immediately relevant to the DH/PH overlap.  Likely some bigger thinking is required to map general museum informatics over this too. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There has been lots of talk over the years about the convergence of libraries, archives and museums in the digital realm, but I think there is a lack of discussions about convergence of DH &#38;amp; LAM in general.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There's also a group operating out of Cleveland State University called the Center for Public History &#38;amp; Digital Humanities: &#60;a href=&#34;http://csudigitalhumanities.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://csudigitalhumanities.org/&#60;/a&#62;  I'm not familiar with them beyond a little exploration of their site, but they may be good folks to talk to.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A couple of us public history/museum/digital humanities types keep noting the parallels between the mores and techniques of the two fields, but not a whole lot has been done systematically that I'm aware of, either.  Sharon's series that SheRah1918 noted above does a nice job of addressing those parallels.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There's evidently a special issue of &#60;em&#62;Library Trends&#60;/em&#62; coming out soon on &#34;Involving Users in the Co-Construction of Digital Knowledge in Libraries, Archives and Museums,&#34; but I'm not sure when we can expect it.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Paul Marty, who is one of the editors of that issue, is also one of the editors of &#60;em&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Museum-Informatics-Information-Technology-Routledge/dp/0824725816&#34;&#62;Museum Informatics: People, Information, and Technology in Museums&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/em&#62;, which while not drawing the parallels between DH and PH explicitly does address some areas of commonality.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/profile/sherah1918'&#62;SheRah1918&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/booksarticlesblogs-about-digital-public-history-and-museums#post-360&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm happy a couple I knew were on the list... Although unsurprisingly there are several I don't...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There isn't a lot out there, Tad. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I think a good starting place for all things related to digital history is Roy and Dan's book, Digital History: &#60;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Sharon Leon has a nice 3-part series called 21st-Century Public History that speaks more directly to museums and public historians: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.6floors.org/bracket/2010/04/21/21st-century-public-history-part-i/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.6floors.org/bracket/2010/04/21/21st-century-public-history-part-i/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Nancy Proctor's Digital: Museum as Platform, Curator as Champion, in the Age of Social Media (Curator, Jan 2010), is another:  &#60;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2151-6952.2009.00006.x/full&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2151-6952.2009.00006.x/full&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And then there is a book that I haven't read yet:&#60;br /&#62;
Theorizing digital cultural heritage : a critical discourse by Fiona Cameron and Sarah Kenderdine (Cambridge, Mass. : MIT Press, 2007)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A coworker of mine is looking for suggestions, trying to find material about the point of convergence between digital humanities and public history museums. I can think of a couple, but as I'm fairly new to the museum side of things, I thought I'd turn the question over to a larger body of folks who're in the know.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What should one read, if one is looking to sound well-informed when talking about such topics?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(Also, why is there no &#34;public humanities&#34; related category...?)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
