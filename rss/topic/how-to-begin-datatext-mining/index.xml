			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Ian Thomas's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-to-begin-datatext-mining#post-1734&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We can ask many questions of that project. One that we're particularly interested in the small group we have going at Columbia U. is to figure out how canons are formed through pedagogical practices in the academy. Topic modeling also comes to mind as a possible approach. Of course, revisiting the million syllabi project properly would concern itself with problems larger than data mining questions. We are interested, for example and all obstacles aside for now, to have a resource that teachers can access to stay abreast of curricular developments. I hope we get more buy-in in this thread to see how others are thinking about Cohen's project.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd be interested in joining in that group. I guess my problem is that I don't quite know what questions to ask. What do I need to learn to be able to dig into that data? I think that MySQL stuff is involved, but I really am not sure.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Hi, Ian. Thanks for asking this question. I'm very interested in forming a working group for folks who want to revisit Dan Cohen's millio syllabi project. I'm very curious to see what kinds of answers you get here, but also to see who would be interested in participating in such a group.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have some ideas for different projects involving the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dancohen.org/2011/03/30/a-million-syllabi/&#34;&#62;million syllabi&#60;/a&#62; that Dan Cohen collected but I'm not sure where to start. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know some of you have done work on that data already and I'm hoping you can point me in the right direction to start.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
