			<description>&#60;p&#62;50. Can I get a one-to-one tutorial from you about a subject you teach. It will only take an hour. No, I cant just download your teaching materials from the website or come to a lecture you are giving on the subject. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;more positively:&#60;br /&#62;
51. I have a little pot of cash for someone to help sort out our website/database/project domain. Do you have any good grad students we could employ for a couple of days just to sort it out? We will pay good rates, we just dont have the time to do it ourselves.
