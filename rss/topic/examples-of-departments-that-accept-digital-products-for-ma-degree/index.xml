			<description>&#60;p&#62;I guess this topic was originally posted before I finished my MA. I got my MA in classical archaeology from the University of Virginia in 2013. Instead of a traditional research project, I wrote on the technical underpinnings of the Roman coin projects we are doing at the American Numismatic Society and the application of linked data to the UVA numismatic collection, which was basically the culmination of my academic career up to that point. The digital projects weren't accepted in lieu of a thesis however, and they should not have been. The thesis provided a background of the history of the description of coins from the Renaissance to the database era and beyond, with specific use cases detailing the digital future of the discipline. The thesis was basically the digital state of the field in 2013.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not sure that a written thesis should be removed altogether. &#60;em&#62;Something&#60;/em&#62; should be written to place the project into context.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're working on an M.A. in DH at McGill and this is precisely the question I wanted to ask. I'd like to bump the thread in case anyone has anything recent to share. Thanks in advance!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In 2008 &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.stanford.edu/dept/undergrad/ihum/fellows/bios/tiwari.html&#34;&#62;Bulbul Tiwari&#60;/a&#62; received a Ph.D. in South Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago for her dissertation &#60;em&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://lens.lib.uchicago.edu/?hreciid=&#124;library/marc/uc&#124;7136159&#34;&#62;Maha Multipedia: The Mahabharata reworked in mixed media for a nine night performance&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/em&#62;. This was the first entirely digital dissertation at Chicago. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Since I know a policy for all electronic dissertation had been decided a few years earlier I'm pretty sure Chicago would accept them for an M.A. as well. Best to check with the UC library's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/phd/&#34;&#62;dissertation office&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi all!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I’m looking for examples of humanities or history departments that allow students to produce digital products for MA thesis and/or PhD dissertation credit. Better yet, I’d like to find language from departmental operating papers or catalogs about accepting digital work for graduate credit.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My history department at a regional masters comprehensive university is considering allowing students to produce digital products for the MA in lieu of the traditional history thesis. If possible, I’d like to draw on examples from other departments that are already doing this rather than inventing the procedures from scratch. Any ideas or recommendations?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For all you grad students out there, I’d like to mention that this idea came from several students doing innovative projects. If you believe in innovative digital scholarship, keep pushing for it!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Jeff Manuel
