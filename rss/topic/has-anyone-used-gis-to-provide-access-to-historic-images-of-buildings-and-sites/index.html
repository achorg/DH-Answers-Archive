			<description>&#60;p&#62;We've done some things that are close to this. There are images integrated in to this Omeka project that are coming from Geoserver (&#60;a href=&#34;http://falmouth.lib.virginia.edu/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://falmouth.lib.virginia.edu/)&#60;/a&#62;. Also, just today I saw a pretty slick demo of what UNC is doing with some of their maps and images (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.unc.edu/dc/geobrowse/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.lib.unc.edu/dc/geobrowse/&#60;/a&#62;) which may be more along the lines of what you're looking to do. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The technique that I keep seeing used is to index the components in to Solr and use coordinates to plot objects on a map. It's relatively straight forward once you determine how you want to store the points and polygons in the index.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I haven't done this specifically, but it seems pretty similar to historypin.com.  I'd explore that as an option if you haven't done so already.  Some LAMs and historical societies have already put their collections onto it, e.g. &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.historypin.com/profile/view/Kansas%20City%20Public%20Library&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.historypin.com/profile/view/Kansas%20City%20Public%20Library&#60;/a&#62;
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am working with the Collingswood (NJ) Library on trying to improve access to maps, images and historical information in the collection. I have developed a rudimentary ARC-GIS application that calls up historic images of specific locations. Has any Digital Humanities member used this sort of application in their own library or archive?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
