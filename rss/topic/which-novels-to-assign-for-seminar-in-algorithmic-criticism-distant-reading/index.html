&#60;p&#62;Sure. Right now I have no travel plans for July. When you're ready, drop me a note. I'm going to be working on the repo some in June, and I'm making a note to add the PDF. Part of my plan is also to turn chunks of it into an iPython notebook (now Jupyter) which would allow there to be a mix of exposition (written in Markdown) with code that can be executed live. (I have a pretty complete run-down on how to set all this up on a Mac, if anyone is interested.)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Thanks very much, John! I'd love to review the PDF version, too, and talk to you about exercises. Perhaps in July when I start developing the course? You can reach me at ullyot[@]ucalgary[.]ca or @&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/profile/ullyot'&#62;ullyot&#60;/a&#62; on Twitter.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you want something intermediate between Codecademy's Python tutorials and Jockers' R, as well as a small text through which you can work methodically with your students, I've got a small collection of commented Python scripts in a GitHub repository. It comes with a plain text version of &#34;The Most Dangerous Game.&#34; I can also include a PDF version I've long used, which gives you a paginated source for comparison. If you're interested, I can also add notes on the exercises/activities that I use in conjunction with the text. (Essentially, I use it as a way to get students thinking about both the advantages of working through the particularities of texts computationally -- e.g., KWiC -- as well as some of the underlying statistics behind things like topic modeling.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's the repo: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/johnlaudun/upst&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/johnlaudun/upst&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I’m designing the graduate seminar I’ll teach in the Department of English this fall (2015) on the subject of ‘Algorithmic Criticism,’ a title I took from the subtitle of Stephen Ramsay’s 2011 book, Reading Machines. It’s an introduction to computational text-analysis for students of literature, from word frequency to topic modelling.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;By the end of the course, students will be comfortable moving between close reading and distant reading, or what Matthew Jockers calls micro-, meso-, and macro-analysis. (Along with Ramsay’s book, Jockers’ 2013 study Macroanalysis and his 2014 guide to Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature will be required readings.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Students will learn and implement some programming basics using Python and R, so they can see what happens when natural-language processing and other tools parse and rearrange the words in both individual texts and larger corpora. I haven’t developed more detailed course outcomes than that. We’ll use Codecademy’s Python tutorials alongside Jockers’ book on R.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So which literary texts do you assign for old-fashioned linear close readings in a course like this? They should be long enough to have a lot of words to work with, and complex enough that they contain a lot of topics. They should provide good contrasts with each other – that is, contain a lot of different words and topics – yet be close enough in time that the comparison makes sense. And they should be in the public domain, so we have texts to manipulate in whatever repository we’re drawing them from.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
