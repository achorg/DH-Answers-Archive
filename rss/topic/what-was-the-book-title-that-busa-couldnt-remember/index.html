Although some say that I am the pioneer of the computers in the humanities, such a title needs a good deal of nuancing... [O]n the stacks of the IBM library in New York City I had spotted a book (whose title I have forgotten), which was printed some time between 1920 and 1940: in it someone mentioned that it was possible to make lists of names by means of punched cards.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Has anybody figured out what book he may have had in mind?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;All best,&#60;br /&#62;
