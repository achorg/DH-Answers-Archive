			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @ethan.watrall's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-tech-would-you-buy-for-a-new-cultural-heritage-informatics-space#post-1000&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Probably too late now but here are a few more ideas: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) Photo GPS tagger device. Lots to choose from, lots of good reviews around.&#60;br /&#62;
2) Bright, versatile, 3D capable 720p projector (i.e. instead of a $$$ 1080p unit). e.g. Dell S300w if you can live with the short-throw. Else a unit that has really good color matching and is native 4:3 (for your art historians..). e.g. Canon's LCOS series. I found Projector Central to be a good resource (esp. their search interface). Shutterglasses.&#60;br /&#62;
3) Don't spend $$ on high-end DSLR. It's cost half as much 2 years later anyway. Instead invest in good tripod and tripod head for VR panoramas. Ideally with horizontal and vertical click-stops (for cubic panoramas) and off-axis correction. Better yet, buy a DSLR with a tripod mount point that is centered on the sensor plane (these days most are). Best get a simple laser based device to measure distance accurately too. Very helpful in the field.&#60;br /&#62;
4). Rotating plate (also with click stops) for Object VRs&#60;br /&#62;
5). Good, neutral cold-lighting kit. These are expensive but very much worth it.&#60;br /&#62;
6). Good quality copy stand. Possible also a book cradle. You might need to ask your friendly theatre or visual art department to build one for you as these are very expensive.&#60;br /&#62;
7). Colorimeter &#38;amp; light meter.&#60;br /&#62;
8). High-quality, large LCD monitors.&#60;br /&#62;
9). 3D printer and scanner.. well, one can dream. The good ones (especially the scanners) are still very expensive.&#60;br /&#62;
10). Good quality video camera with its own tripod w/fluid head. Else a DSLR with good video capture features (think exchangeable lenses..). The Luminous Landscape has some good articles on this.&#60;br /&#62;
11) XBox and Kinect. PlayStation and whatever their 3D gizmo is called. Both for hacking the 3D features. I personally think 3D in cinema is a fad but there's a lot of potential for it in the cultural heritage world.&#60;br /&#62;
12) Wii for hacking the3D features for tactile control (ala Jonnhy Chung).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There, that was fun. cheers.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;thanks to all who contributed their thoughts.  I've submitted the tech funding request - we'll see if the college thinks it deserving of funding.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Ha!  I had almost all of those on my list already.  The only difference is that I'm going with Kodak Zi8s instead of the Flip...and we're not going to buy project management software (as we'll use TRAC)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Lets get specific - Quad Mac, LaCie 526 25.5 monitor, Epson Expression 10000XL Flatbed scanner, Canon EOS 50D SLR camera body, Canon EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Autofocus Lens, Adobe CS, Project Management software (we use 37Signals BackPack), Flip Ultra HD, maybe a large photo stand for digitizing oversize items. That's just off the top of my head, tools and toys I could see being useful in a digital project space.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Dorothea Salo's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-tech-would-you-buy-for-a-new-cultural-heritage-informatics-space#post-984&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This isn't a service lab (in the traditional sense) - like the UVA Scholar's Lab, for example.  There is no staff infrastructure to speak of - which is very much in line with the DIY/Building as a Way of Knowing ethos of the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for your other suggestions, a good projection method is definitely important.  I've got a good HD projector on the list already.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Well, I'd really advise you to go out there and talk to some potential users. You don't want to assume what their needs are, and get it wrong!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One thing I would encourage you to ask about is digitization; this often gets ignored in the Rush To The Shiny, but it's a real need. What analog research materials do faculty have that might be better off digital? What equipment would be needed to digitize them? What expertise and labor to digitize them &#60;em&#62;correctly&#60;/em&#62;? Roughly how many {mega-,giga-,tera-,peta}bytes of digital information would that represent, and is there the preservation and presentation infrastructure to handle that?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Software and software &#60;em&#62;development&#60;/em&#62; is clearly going to be a sticking point with that broad a variety of projects, particularly given (forgive me for saying this out loud) the low tech-savvy in the cultural-heritage space generally. What are you prepared to train people on? What are you prepared to build for people? What's the minimum tech-savvy (and tech LABOR) they'll need to pony up to play in your space?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I realize you're asking about physical space and physical tools here, and I haven't answered those questions... but the non-physical demands of what you want to do are actually worrying me quite a bit more. As we plan for a similar physical space, the requirements we're hearing are fairly straightforward: schedulable meeting space on neutral turf, presentation capacity (either a projector or a large-screen monitor), flexible and collaboration-friendly room configurations and furniture, good networking.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Honestly, I'm setting the &#34;agenda&#34; here - am just trying to support the widest possible variety of projects (and learning experiences).  There will most likely be some heavy GIS and digital cartography stuff, digital repository &#38;amp; digital library projects, mobile projects, game (meaningful play) projects, &#34;traditional&#34; web projects, video &#38;amp; audio projects, data visualization projects, linked data projects...
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Could you tell us more about what people have told you they want to do in this space?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm making a tech request to upgrade/renovate/build a tech lab for the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative here at MSU (chi.matrix.msu.edu).  I've got some general ideas as to what is going to be in the request.  However, I thought I would throw the question out to the community and see if people had suggestions for purchases - stuff that I may not have thought about.  These could include software, hardware, peripherals, online services &#38;amp; sites, etc.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This lab would mostly be used for cultural heritage informatics projects - anthropology, archaeology, history, classics, art history, museology, historic geography, etc.  (though, that hardly is a good representation of the kinds of things that it might end up being used for).  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, what would you request?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
