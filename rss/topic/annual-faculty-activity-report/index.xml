			<description>&#60;p&#62;BibApp seems to work well for pulling together all faculty research citations; this is what our university's research office is looking for. However, it doesn't seem to support the annual report categories: research, teaching, and service or the submission of annual reports that I was looking for. It would be useful to integrate both easy submission of annual reports and the access to data for the research office and other offices.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is a question that's been on my mind, too.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Has anyone used Zotero to do this? Or even better built something on top of Zotero's API? That seems like a logical starting point.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am looking for tools that universities use to allow faculty to submit their annual activity reports online that would then allow the different offices to pull and compiles relevant information. The office of serving learning could then gather all the data related to service learning and civic engagement in the reports. I was thinking about it in terms of my department chair and dean putting together their annual reports. Today, I talked with our computing services and it turns out our research office wants something similar that would allow them to pull out a report on a keyword search -- such as what's going on in digital humanities at Wright State?  It would be great if faculty to could login and add to the report under the different headings throughout the year and then click submit when they want to share it or turn it in. It would help, of course, if it would format all the publications, grants, etc. for us as well. Is there something open source that does this now? Right now, we each submit the report as a word file.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
