			<description>&#60;p&#62;You need a good research question first. And then you need to find an institution that has a supervisor that can supervise that question. In your case, you'd have to think what type of a department would have that person. I don't know much about terroir studies.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you get an unqualified supervisor who has no idea about your research question then you are going to struggle.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello to all and I am very thankful to find this forum!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am wanting to attend a PhD program in Digital Humanities. (Eyes on King's College) I am struggling to write a proper research proposal to find an advisor there. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am a technologist (not a programmer!) interested in how DH can be used in Food Studies. When I proposed this as an introduction I was told, that's really just a project, not a research question. Turns out, as a technologist, I am great at coming up with digital projects that involve food studies but they all seem to lack a research 'hook' to get me any further. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My current favorite idea, of a few scribbled down, is related to the study of wine (I am a certified sommelier):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What can a digital humanities approach to wine reveal about the definition of terroir in the region of Barolo, Italy?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Can anyone point me in a good direction? Thank you!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
