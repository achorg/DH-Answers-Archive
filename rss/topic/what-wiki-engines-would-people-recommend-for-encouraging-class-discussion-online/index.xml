			<description>&#60;p&#62;I wonder if a wiki is really what's wanted?  (Or maybe why it is?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To me, wikis don't facilitate discussion in the way that, say, blogs or bulletin-board-type platforms do.  They're great for collaboration, but I've not seen a grand discussion break out on a wiki very often.  (Wikis are the center of all my classes, but it's for something pretty different.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.pbworks.com&#34;&#62;PBWorks&#60;/a&#62; could provide some of this functionality, as it allows comments on wiki pages.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Was posed this question in relation to an instructor setting up a class that will focus on a specific series of videos and who wants to have as much mutual reading and discussion as possible.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
