&#60;p&#62;Thanks Wally – the save to DT inbox will do the trick.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;DEVONthink Pro Office has a plugin that enables import of messages or complete mailboxes--Apple Mail, Unix mbox format (e.g., Thunderbird) or Entourage--preserving formatting and keeping the attachments intact.   I use this method to archive all my old mail and sent messages (trying to have no more than about 6 weeks of mail in my email client).  The full-text searching and AI on retrieval means I can quickly go thru thousands of emails to get the one I'm trying to find.  Works really well.  But you say you just want to move selected messages from Thunderbird...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While there's a plugin included for Apple Mail that puts an &#34;add to Devonthink&#34; menu option right in the email client, it's not so clean with other email clients.  But it is possible.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's one way to get an email into DevonThink from Thunderbird--save the message as an .eml file and put that into DEVONthink.  How?   &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) While in Thunderbird, as you're reading an email you want to keep, press COMMAND-S (or select File...Save As...File from the main menu).&#60;br /&#62;
2) Select the DEVONthink Inbox as your save destination.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Once you've saved the first message into the DEVONthink inbox, that will be the default destination for subsequent messages during that email session.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;From the DEVONthink inbox you can then move messages to the appropriate database(s).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There's been some recent talk about DevonThink and I'm giving it a go, but – despite having looked at the DevonThink manual, done some quick web searches, and looked for extensions – I can't seem to find a decent way to really integrate with Thunderbird. What I'd like to do is to send individual messages to DT as I'm reading them in TB. Suggestions?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
