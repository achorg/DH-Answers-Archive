			<description>&#60;p&#62;Canadian (well, American-in-Canada) perspective here. DH-in-libraries is still a relatively nascent item, so I for one am focusing regional -- going to THATcamps, doing local evangelism. Our own library based DH centre is still in development, so perhaps when it spins up and things even out a bit there might be a call to think a little more broadly.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A little birdie told me that ALA Midwinter in Dallas will have a panel called &#34;Online and Above the Radar: Ensuring the Use and Discoverability of Digital Collections&#34;, which hopefully will have some Omeka representation, so that's something?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Micah Vandegrift's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/are-library-associations-ignoring-digital-humanities#post-1474&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;RBMS is calling for some pre-conference papers on DH (and I'm submitting with the director of our special collections):  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;RBMS 2012 Preconference Call for Short Papers&#60;br /&#62;
SUBMISSION DEADLINE: December 15, 2011&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;FUTURES!&#60;br /&#62;
53rd Annual RBMS Preconference&#60;br /&#62;
San Diego, California&#60;br /&#62;
June 19 - 22, 2012&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Planning for the 2012 RBMS Preconference is entering the final stages.&#60;br /&#62;
This year's theme is FUTURES! The 2012 RBMS Preconference will explore&#60;br /&#62;
a multiplicity of futures for the rare book, manuscript, and special&#60;br /&#62;
collections community. How are special collections materials being&#60;br /&#62;
discovered and used today? How will they be discovered and used&#60;br /&#62;
tomorrow? Who will our users be, and what will they need? What forms&#60;br /&#62;
will special collections materials take? Join us to learn, discuss,&#60;br /&#62;
share, and contemplate. Now is the time to shape and prepare, because&#60;br /&#62;
the future is now.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Preconference will feature engaging plenaries, educational&#60;br /&#62;
seminars, lively discussion groups, and dynamic short paper&#60;br /&#62;
presentations. Plenary sessions will address three facets of our&#60;br /&#62;
theme:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Use: Digital Humanities&#60;br /&#62;
Discovery: Linked Open Data&#60;br /&#62;
Object: Book&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Clearly there are many, many more aspects of this theme to explore, so&#60;br /&#62;
we invite short paper submissions that address our theme in creative&#60;br /&#62;
and thought-provoking ways. Short papers can be broadly theoretical or&#60;br /&#62;
solidly practical; they can be the result of intense personal research&#60;br /&#62;
or the fruit of a productive collaboration.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A subcommittee of the 2012 RBMS Preconference Program Planning&#60;br /&#62;
Committee will review all submissions and select and organize the&#60;br /&#62;
papers into intellectually coherent clusters of three or four 15 to 20&#60;br /&#62;
minute presentations. There will be one time slot during which four&#60;br /&#62;
short paper sessions will run concurrently.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Proposals of 500 words or less should be sent to Mike Kelly&#60;br /&#62;
(mkelly@amherst.edu) no later than December 15, 2011. Final selections&#60;br /&#62;
by the Short Papers Subcommittee will be announced early in the New&#60;br /&#62;
Year.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Short Papers Subcommittee:&#60;br /&#62;
Mike Kelly, Amherst College&#60;br /&#62;
Melissa Nykanen, Pepperdine University&#60;br /&#62;
Katie L.B. Henningsen, University of Kentucky&#60;br /&#62;
Karla Nielsen, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A Note on Preconference Program Planning: The process of Preconference&#60;br /&#62;
Programming is not always clear to newcomers to the section, and even&#60;br /&#62;
some who have been around for a while. The Preconference Program&#60;br /&#62;
Planning Committee is responsible for the overall theme and schedule&#60;br /&#62;
of the conference, including selecting plenary speakers and organizing&#60;br /&#62;
discussion sessions. Their work began at the 2011 Midwinter meeting in&#60;br /&#62;
San Diego. The Seminars Committee is responsible for development of&#60;br /&#62;
seminars that may, or may not, be directly tied to the Preconference&#60;br /&#62;
theme. The 2012 Preconference will feature ten seminars, some of which&#60;br /&#62;
have been in development for over a year. Short papers are a way to&#60;br /&#62;
open the Preconference to participation from a wider range of voices&#60;br /&#62;
than may be represented in the other sessions on a shorter timeline.&#60;br /&#62;
Those interested in helping to shape the 2013 Preconference, should&#60;br /&#62;
attend the first meeting of the 2013 Preconference Program Planning&#60;br /&#62;
Committee during ALA Midwinter in Dallas.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There was a great deal of emphasis on the digital humanities at DLF's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.diglib.org/forums/2011forum/&#34;&#62;most recent forum&#60;/a&#62;, and the Digital Library Federation has also launched a partnership with &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet&#34;&#62;centerNet&#60;/a&#62;, an international alliance of digital humanities labs and centers, around a set of shared interests:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.diglib.org/community/collaborations/centernet/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.diglib.org/community/collaborations/centernet/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;DLF also sponsored conference registration discounts for a number of first-time librarian attendees at the annual &#60;a href=&#34;//dh2011.stanford.edu&#34;&#62;DH conference&#60;/a&#62; last summer at Stanford, which I thought was terrific.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In general, many librarians are members of the &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org&#34;&#62;ADHO&#60;/a&#62; organizations, including the &#60;a href=&#34;http://ach.org&#34;&#62;ACH&#60;/a&#62; (your friendly hosts of DH Answers!).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Yes, ACRL is the place to look: An ACRL Digital Humanities Interest Group was just launched this fall, and we'll be having our first meeting at ALA Annual 2012.  Also, we are organizing a Digital Humanities and Librarians pre-conference that will be held at ALA Annual 2012, and more details about that will be coming out this spring. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Other library-related organizations that are good places to look at are DLF (www.diglib.org), Council of Library and Information Resources (CLIR, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.clir.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.clir.org&#60;/a&#62;), and the Assocation of Research Libraries, which just published a report on digital humanities centers in libraries at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arl.org/news/pr/spec326-6dec11.shtml&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.arl.org/news/pr/spec326-6dec11.shtml&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Well... here's a further question - where are current DHbrarians investing their professional development at the association level? I'm struggling to reconcile this with the grand idea of the Big Tent (librarianship and DH), and how I want to support it, but my interests in the field are starting out so specialized. I want to invest my time in exciting, new, developing areas. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Will look in to your recommendations, thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;ALA is the wrong level to look at, as you suspected. Watch ACRL. Also keep an eye on the Coalition for Networked Information and the Association for Research Libraries. Another possibility is the academic section of the Special Libraries Association.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There is a lot of talk about the major disciplinary conferences like MLA and AHA having substantial increases in sessions devoted to digital humanities. I am worried/wondering why library associations like ALA (American Library Association) don't seem to be invested in this. Is this true or is it just my perception? Is ALA too big and maybe it is better recognized in the smaller divisions like ACRL (Association of College and Research Libraries)? If librarians are to be active partners in DH work, which professional organizations are supporting and investing in this area?
