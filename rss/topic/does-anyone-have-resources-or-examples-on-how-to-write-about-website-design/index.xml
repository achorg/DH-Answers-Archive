			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/mlholloway251'&#62;mlholloway251&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/does-anyone-have-resources-or-examples-on-how-to-write-about-website-design#post-2425&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you're not already involved there, it could also be useful to join &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.hastac.org/&#34;&#62;HASTAC&#60;/a&#62; and blog about your process/questions that come upâ€”there's a pretty good community of commenters there.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Some of the pieces of my &#60;a href=&#34;http://dr.amandavisconti.com/&#34;&#62;(completed) digital dissertation&#60;/a&#62; using web design/development for literature scholarship might be useful? Some specific links below, but also check out &#60;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qJwx0nYam3aJazetVfmij6q92Owv-gu_pfl-Xci6BLM/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&#62;this great GoogleDoc&#60;/a&#62; some folks at CUNY curated with info on a variety of digital dissertation formats.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/dissertation/&#34;&#62;some blog posts&#60;/a&#62; both about the design of a digital edition website for my dissertation, and about the design of the websites presenting the dissertation (e.g. &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/04/02/digitaldissformat&#34;&#62;post on choosing and arguing for digital dissertation design&#60;/a&#62;, and &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/03/31/html5scholarlyarticle&#34;&#62;some design choices&#60;/a&#62;, and &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2014/09/16/user-testing-a-digital-edition-getting-the-feedback-you-need&#34;&#62;user testing dissertation websites&#60;/a&#62;). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A skim of the table of contents for &#60;a href=&#34;http://dr.amandavisconti.com/AmandaVisconti_DigitalDissertationWhitepaper_OfficialSubmission.pdf&#34;&#62;the whitepaper debriefing my digital dissertation&#60;/a&#62; might also be useful?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I also found it useful to &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-dissertation/blob/master/About%20the%20Dissertation/MANIFEST.md&#34;&#62;make a list of all the scholarly effort that went into the digital dissertation&#60;/a&#62;, annotated to explain the website-related work that might not be obvious to scholarly evaluators.
