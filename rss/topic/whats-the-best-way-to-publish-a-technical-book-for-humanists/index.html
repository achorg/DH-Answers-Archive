			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;1. How do you (and people you know) go about finding technical &#34;books&#34;? Do brick-and-mortar bookstores play much of a role?&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I occasionally browse the tech section in books-and-mortar bookstores, but rarely buy technical books from them. I do have tropisms toward certain technical publishers I know to be reliable, and certain authors I find comprehensible.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;    &#60;em&#62;2. Be honest, would you judge a self-published technical book to be less trustworthy or authoritative than one published by a well-known publisher?&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Even the tech publishers I love best sometimes publish complete turkeys. For me, tech-book purchases are purely instrumental: does it teach something I need to know, in a manner I find learnable? If I bounce off the language (Michael Kay on XSLT) or find the approach too cutesy to stand (Head Start), that's that.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have a standing bookmark to &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.niche-canada.org/programming-historian&#34;&#62;The Programming Historian&#60;/a&#62; because it's good stuff. That it was originally self-published doesn't make a lick of difference to me.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;    &#60;em&#62;3. Are there &#34;publishers&#34; (loosely defined) or other publication-related organizations (like the Institute for the Future of the Book) that might be worth talking to about the possibility of making the work available under their umbrella, to help provide some of the credibility that traditional publication would provide?&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Certainly. Consider &#60;a href=&#34;http://openhumanitiespress.org/&#34;&#62;Open Humanities Press&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://pressforward.org/&#34;&#62;PressForward&#60;/a&#62;, or even O'Reilly if you can interest them in it.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Elijah Meeks and I are working on writing &#34;Drupal for Humanists&#34;, with the goal of producing something that's relevant and readable for people ranging from undergrads and DH newbies to tech-savvy folks in DH, the library, and university IT. We were thinking of going the traditional find-a-publisher route, but there's some significant downsides, including:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Turning all rights over to the publisher&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;The near-impossibility of finding a publisher who'd be okay with Creative Commons licensing&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;The fact that some of the details of the content will go out of date quickly, and we won't be able to just update it freely&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We're thinking about just publishing it for free as a web-based version that we can expand and update at will, while offering a self-published print copy from a print-on-demand publisher for people who want to learn from &#34;a book&#34;. We could also make the print version available on Amazon. I like this plan on a number of levels, from convenience to ideology, but I'm wondering if it might fall short of achieving our goal of making something that lots of people actually use.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ol&#62;
&#60;li&#62;How do you (and people you know) go about finding technical &#34;books&#34;? Do brick-and-mortar bookstores play much of a role? (We almost certainly wouldn't be able to get into those.)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Be honest, would you judge a self-published technical book to be less trustworthy or authoritative than one published by a well-known publisher?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Are there &#34;publishers&#34; (loosely defined) or other publication-related organizations (like the Institute for the Future of the Book) that might be worth talking to about the possibility of making the work available under their umbrella, to help provide some of the credibility that traditional publication would provide?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Anything else we should be thinking about?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ol&#62;</description>
