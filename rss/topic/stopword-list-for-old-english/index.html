			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the response. That fits what I was expecting given the variability of the language.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've tried to generate Old English stop word lists for various experiments from time to time, but never to my satisfaction. Spelling variation is a problem, though not as bad as Middle English. But there is also a tremendous amount of homography--so much that it is almost better to generate a list of homographs and tag forms with separate meanings in the source text(s) before doing anything else. After that, you can just generate a list of the most frequent forms in the corpus. You'll probably then have to tailor this list by deleting forms like &#34;w√¶s&#34; or &#34;cwom&#34; if they're not relevant to your experiment.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I haven't been able to turn up an existing stop word list for Old English. Does anyone know of one? Thanks!
