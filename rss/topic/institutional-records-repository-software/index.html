			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you need records management facilities like retention and access control, you probably will find that most options are commercial. &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.alfresco.com/&#34;&#62;Alfresco&#60;/a&#62; is one of the few open source offerings, &#38;amp; it has a free &#34;community&#34; (read - non-supported!) edition.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've heard vague rumbling rumours in the past that the Kuali (&#60;a href=&#34;http://kuali.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://kuali.org&#60;/a&#62;) people were working on records management software, but digging around their site doesn't really yield anything solid, although I suppose that their student records management, financial, and/or grants tracking software might cover some of what people are looking for.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, Stefan,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You might want to keep an eye on the #idcc10 hashtag on Twitter. We've been discussing this heavily at the International Digital Curation Conference. Unfortunately, wireless here is chancy, so I can't give the lengthy response I want to just yet.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;People you should follow definitely include Chris Prom and his Practical E-Records blog. Emerging tools in this area include Archivematica, Curator's Workbench, and the Duke Data Accessioner.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Fedora Commons is indeed being used as the underlying storage in such projects, but it's not the only storage layer by any means.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A committee on campus has been formed to try to figure out some strategies for managing institutional documents (both print and digital). Yes, this is obviously an enormous undertaking and there are commercial solutions that are worth exploring. My question is whether anyone has tried something like this at a large scale with similar kinds of documents, perhaps using open-source components like Fedora. I need to emphasize how diverse the documents are (in content, in medium, etc.) and the need for records management pieces like retention and access policies.
