			<description>&#60;p&#62;Not specifically a web-based project, but perhaps the &#60;a href=&#34;http://vue.tufts.edu/&#34;&#62;Visual Understanding Environment (VUE)&#60;/a&#62; tools from Tufts would be of use here? (It's more or less a mind-mapping tool on steroids.) I understand that VUE can be connected to an asset repository on the back end, which could be handy for an art historian who has an image database--- but that's all Big-Scale-DH, and might be beyond the scope of what your art historian wants.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Please do post further about what you find that works. I have a colleague whose research in historical visual culture requires the ability to keep track of visual echoes and references in mass-culture images-- specifically with reference to time-- and I'd love to know what tools are out there for this sort of task.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;How about something like &#60;a href=&#34;https://republicofletters.stanford.edu/&#34;&#62;Mapping the Republic of Letters&#60;/a&#62;, where you can see networks. In the implementation you're thinking about, however, I would expect to see the lines drawn as vectors rather than just as connections. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Barbara Hui's &#60;a href=&#34;http://barbarahui.net/litmap/&#34;&#62;LITMAP&#60;/a&#62; might be another good example.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(I suppose I could have walked over to your cube to say this, huh?)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been talking to an art historian who wants to create a website that will map the influence of a particular body of works over time and space. Like: this work influenced that work, in this place, at this time. I'm having trouble picturing what this could look like, so I'm hoping you can point me to sites that do something like this in an interesting way.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is, I think, a design and interface question, not a data analysis question -- the art historian will create links among works using her own expertise, not large datasets.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks, as always!
