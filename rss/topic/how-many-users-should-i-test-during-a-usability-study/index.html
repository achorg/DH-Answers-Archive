			<description>&#60;p&#62;Would just add the somewhat obvious* point that Nielsen's caveat about highly distinct user groups definitely applies to a university web design.  Keep the groups as small as possible, as long as those groups are diverse (students, faculty, staff, other stakeholders).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;*but &#60;a href=&#34;http://xkcd.com/773/&#34;&#62;oft-ignored&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I would add to the above excellent answers that it's good to plan for iterative testing. So you do your first tests with 4-6 users, fix some stuff -- then it's time to test again! If you keep your testing groups small, this doesn't have to be horribly onerous.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Erin Mayhood's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-many-users-should-i-test-during-a-usability-study#post-88&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Yep, I would agree that 4-6 is a good number for testing something like a general communications-oriented design.  That number allows for a range of answers and also gives the tester the ability to go into more detail with each user than if there were, say, double or triple that number involved.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For application testing I'd tend toward a larger number of users; in this sense I mean &#34;application&#34; like &#34;something that asks people to do a certain set of interrelated tasks with a programmatic backend&#34;...say, for example, using a new interface for a library catalog.  Since something like that will necessarily be used by people with a wider range of personal approaches to the material, a larger group would expose those approaches and perhaps things needing to be tweaked (or praised!).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;When performing usability testing I test between 4-6 users. You will find that testing beyond this number of users gets repetitive. Jakob Nielsen's March 19, 2000 AlertBox recommends 5 users and gives a good explanation here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am working on a new design for my institution's website and would like to test the design with some users. How many users do I need to bring in?
