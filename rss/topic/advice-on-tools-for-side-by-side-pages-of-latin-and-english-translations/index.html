			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working with a faculty member who has translated 2 16th century books from Latin to English and has extensively annotated them. Both are lightly TEI encoded and could be more heavily encoded as needed. He would like to display the original and the translation side by side. A page-by-page display, as opposed to a line-by-line display, would be sufficient. When he originally asked for advice a couple years ago I looked at Juxta and the Versioning Machine. Anything new since then that I should look at? He is not looking for witness comparisons, heat maps, or anything too sophisticated. A flip-book view (one page of Latin next to one page of English) would be ideal in terms of what he is visualizing.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;- Hope
