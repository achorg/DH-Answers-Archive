			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='/profile/tdbowman'&#62;tdbowman&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/list-of-scholarly-resources-focused-on-usability-studies-of-dh-projects#post-1344&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hi, this article in &#60;em&#62;Ariadne&#60;/em&#62; talks about applying user-centered design within the context of our NEH-ODH project: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Ridolfo, Jim, William Hart-Davidson, and Michael McLeod. “Balancing Stakeholder Needs:&#60;br /&#62;
Archive 2.0 as Community-centred Design.” &#60;em&#62;Ariadne&#60;/em&#62; 63 (2010). Available:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a&#62;http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue63/ridolfo-et-al/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Related to this we have an article forthcoming in the next special issue of the &#60;em&#62;Journal of Community Informatics&#60;/em&#62; (&#60;a href=&#34;http://ci-journal.net&#34;&#62;http://www.ci-journal.net&#60;/a&#62;) that also talks about iterative design work with cultural stakeholders. Please feel free to e-mail me at &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:ridolfjs@ucmail.uc.edu&#34;&#62;ridolfjs@ucmail.uc.edu&#60;/a&#62; if you'd like to see a copy (I think it should be out in October 2012 in the issue on University-Community informatics).      &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Best regards,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Jim Ridolfo&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thank you for the replies... I will post a relevant list once I've looked through those you both have listed and follow citations.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I agree with both of you regarding the term &#34;usability.&#34; It can have very different meanings in a variety of contexts.  From my previous searches I've discovered that several DH projects perform both informal and formal user studies, with the informal (unpublished) user studies seeming much more prevalent than the published user studies.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Seconding an exploration of use (how is a DH tool being used?) and usefulness (how effective is its use toward its audience's ends?) in addition to usability (how do the individual features function and what is the total impact of this assessment?). I've found that searching for articles mentioning specific DH projects and picking out those with a usability bent was more fruitful than googling for DH + usability.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I explored the use of digital literary texts for a 2009 DH master's thesis at the University of Michigan School of Information; you might be interested in some of the items in that bibliography as well as the discussion of the scarcity of use/usability/usefulness studies in this particular area of DH creations: &#60;a href=&#34;http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/71380&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/71380&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd be happy to see the list you're contemplating creating!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It really depends what you mean by usability. A lot of people say this when they actually mean very much more wide-ranging user studies. I take usability studies to mean simply testing out facets of navigation and web design towards the end of a project. This is good, but it's better to do a proper study, starting as early as possible. So I wouldn't use that as a key word: try users, user study, etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My colleagues and I have done a lot of work in this area, so take a look at my publications page at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dis/people/clairewarwick/publications/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dis/people/clairewarwick/publications/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You should also look at Stan Ruecker's publications: he's done some fascinating work with users, especially on the Orlando project and the MONK and NORA projects. It's worth looking at MONK's webpage as well for details of their work on use cases. This is different from user studies, but can also be helpful. Stan's just written a great book on interface design, which should be very useful.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The LLC volume of conference proceedings for DH2009 includes two interesting articles by Dana Wheeles and John Keating about their work on users.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;More widely you will probably need to consult literature written from an HCI perspective. If you are looking for a good overview of this then try Schneiderman and Plaisant's very helpful book on this &#34;Designing the User Interface&#34;. Of course for web usability you should also look at Nielson's useit.com where you'll find a lot of useful resources including the classic article on testing with five users.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm also writing an overview chapter on users for our forthcoming book DH in Practice. It's not published until next year, but I'll be able to send you a draft chapter soon if you email me. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Best wishes,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Claire

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm interested in academic articles focusing on usability studies of digital humanities projects.  I would like to put together a list of projects and usability resources.  I am interested in usability methods used; more specifically I would like to examine questions from surveys, tasks required, average number of users sampled, intent of study, etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am happy to compose this resource and place it online if the community can start me on my way.  I've done basic Google Scholar searches with &#34;digital humanities&#34; and &#34;usability&#34; and have found a few older resources... I'm looking for current and past examples.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
