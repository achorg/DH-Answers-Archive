			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Wayne Graham's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/tei-basic-question#post-196&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Seconding Wayne's response. Anthologize is young and buggy (but getting better by the day!).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also seconding both Julie and Vika -- that's a good place to start learning about TEI, and I suspect you'll quickly discover how heavyweight and cumbersome it is.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Last, though, Anthologize's TEI is. . . quirky, for various reasons that've come up in the forums. That would make approaching it from the TEI side more complicated.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;But, as Julie said and linked, this is a great question to pursue more in the Anthologize forums!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;One thing to remember about anthologize is that it's alpha software, meaning the software is still young, buggy, and having features added. While I think the software shows a lot of promise, it does have a ways to go before it's in a stable release status. That said, there are some other options if you just want a PDF of selected blog posts, you may check out the PDF24 Articles To PDF plugin (&#60;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pdf24-posts-to-pdf/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pdf24-posts-to-pdf/)&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With TEI, I'll point out that you will need an additional step in order to produce something that doesn't look like code. The TEI Consortium provides a nice set of default stylesheets (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/Tools/Stylesheets/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/Tools/Stylesheets/&#60;/a&#62;) that can produce many different output formats. If you want real control over which output, and how that output is displayed, the TEI format will provide you with the greatest flexibility, with the cost of greater complexity.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I hesitate answering Anthologize questions here in any detail, since there are discussion groups specifically for that in which team members are quite responsive. Also, there's not a lot to go on with regard to the problems you encountered, and there are documented known issues both in technical requirements and the readiness of particular Anthologize modules (&#60;a href=&#34;http://groups.google.com/group/anthologize-users&#34;&#62;see forum&#60;/a&#62;). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As to the question about what TEI is, Vika's link is the place to start. I would also echo her sentiments re: TEI being too heavy for what you want to do, UNLESS you are already using an editor such as &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.oxygenxml.com/&#34;&#62;oXygen&#60;/a&#62; and can easily pull in the TEI output and export to another format via the app.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Others (like Julia Flanders) could say much more about TEI than I will here, but it is an encoding standard in XML for marking up primary materials (often texts of interest to literary studies folks and historians).  A great resource for learning TEI is the new &#60;a href=&#34;http://tbe.kantl.be/TBE/TBE.htm&#34;&#62;TEI by Example&#60;/a&#62; site, though I agree with Vika: TEI doesn't sound like the right tool for what you want to do.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'll let Anthologize experts answer the other part of your question, but for what you need, TEI is probably too heavy.  You can find info on it here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Having just tried to use Anthologize (&#60;a href=&#34;http://anthologize.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://anthologize.org/&#60;/a&#62;) for the first time, and having had problems with the two output formats I know (RTF and PDF) I tried to use the other outputs. I don't know what they are, and I don't know how to use them. One of them is TEI, and I've never worked with it. Anyone have a resource for finding out what it is and what I might do with it? All I want is a version of my students' blog posts that I can save locally and attractively.
