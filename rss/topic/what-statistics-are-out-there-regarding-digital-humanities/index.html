			<description>&#60;p&#62;Nope! But I'm sure @kfitz or others from MLA could dig out that data for you. ACH was pretty much creating a member's guide to sessions of interest, so we weren't really collecting statistical data or thinking about the project in that way.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Brilliant! Thanks Bethany. Tell me, do we/you have ready stats for the total papers at MLA over those years to we can work out the percentages? And are the recent years covered By Mark Sample's work &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.samplereality.com/2011/10/04/digital-humanities-sessions-at-the-2012-mla-conference-in-seattle/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.samplereality.com/2011/10/04/digital-humanities-sessions-at-the-2012-mla-conference-in-seattle/&#60;/a&#62; &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks! I'll add it to the post, to keep things there.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm drawing together a list of various statistics which already exist regarding Digital Humanities. See here &#60;a href=&#34;http://melissaterras.blogspot.com/2011/11/stats-and-digital-humanities.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://melissaterras.blogspot.com/2011/11/stats-and-digital-humanities.html&#60;/a&#62; I'll list these below. But the question is, what other stats exist that can be added to this list? This is putatively to draw an infographic - but really, its just to round up what we are doing, and what numbers already are out there. Can anyone think of anything else which is already available? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;best,&#60;br /&#62;
Melissa&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The growth in interest could be charted by the growth in subscriptions to the Humanist discussion list, 2002 onwards, which is available &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/McCarty__Report_on_Humanist_2008-abbreviated.pdf&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;, although Willard would have to be prodded for the more up to date figures, or they could be gleaned from the &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/administration/steering&#34;&#62;AHDO minutes&#60;/a&#62; from the past few years. (I'll email Willard).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The number of submissions to the DH annual conference (formerly ALLC/ACH), compared with the acceptance rate, could be gathered, from the &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/administration/steering&#34;&#62;ADHO minutes&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;br /&#62;
The number of people on twitter identified as Digital Humanities scholars, in &#60;a href=&#34;https://api.twitter.com/#%21/dancohen/digitalhumanities&#34;&#62;Dan Cohen's comprehensive list&#60;/a&#62;. (It currently stands at 359 individual scholars doing Digital Humanities who are on twitter).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The number of people subscribing to Literary and Linguistic Computing, which means they are part of at least one membership association tied to the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations, and the individual numbers for ALLC, ACH, and Sedi/semi.  (I used to know what that is, given I was membership secretary. It could be found out by asking Lorna Hughes, or Dave Beaven who does membership for ALLC. I suspect is it around 250 these days. I'll email, and update later).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A list - and $ total - of &#60;a href=&#34;https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?q=1&#38;amp;n=0&#38;amp;o=0&#38;amp;k=0&#38;amp;f=0&#38;amp;s=0&#38;amp;p=0&#38;amp;d=1&#38;amp;dv=12&#38;amp;y=0&#38;amp;pg=0&#38;amp;ob=year&#38;amp;or=DESC&#34;&#62;all the grants that the National Endowment for the Humanities, from the Office of Digital Humanities&#60;/a&#62;. This is via &#60;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#%21/brettbobley&#34;&#62;@brettbobley&#60;/a&#62;.  I'm getting a total of 250 projects, with an outright award of $15,268,130 total (although I'm doing this on a tiny screen, so do correct me if I'm wrong, I need to see the spreadsheet on a much larger monitor to make sure that is correct!).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;wow. thats a lot.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The list - and $ total - of the joint &#60;a href=&#34;https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?q=1&#38;amp;n=0&#38;amp;o=0&#38;amp;k=0&#38;amp;f=0&#38;amp;s=0&#38;amp;p=1&#38;amp;pv=257&#38;amp;d=0&#38;amp;y=0&#38;amp;pg=0&#38;amp;ob=year&#38;amp;or=DESC&#34;&#62;NEH and JISC grants awarded for Digital Humanities&#60;/a&#62; projects  (via &#60;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#%21/brettbobley&#34;&#62;@brettbobley&#60;/a&#62;, and &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/alastairdunning&#34;&#62;@alastairdunning&#60;/a&#62; ). I'm getting 8 projects with an outright award of $966,691 (although again, teeny screen and large spreadsheet issues, do check my working).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#%21/lisaspiro&#34;&#62;Lisa Spiro&#60;/a&#62; identified &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2011/06/20/making-sense-of-134-dh-syllabi-dh-2011-presentation/&#34;&#62;134 courses in Digital Humanities worldwide&#60;/a&#62;in her 2011 paper at DH.&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#%21/search/samplereality&#34;&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
Mark Sample&#60;/a&#62; has been charting the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.samplereality.com/2011/10/04/digital-humanities-sessions-at-the-2012-mla-conference-in-seattle/&#34;&#62;growth of Digital Humanities sessions at MLA over the past few years&#60;/a&#62;. 2010: 27, 2011: 44, 2012: 58.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#%21/alastairdunning&#34;&#62;Alastair Dunning&#60;/a&#62; suggests we could look at &#60;a title=&#34;http://arts-humanities.net&#34; href=&#34;http://t.co/rhyuQrdr&#34;&#62;http://arts-humanities.net&#60;/a&#62; for some more project information, although I think that takes some digging to get some stats.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There is the uber cool &#60;a href=&#34;http://dh2011network.stanford.edu/&#34;&#62;Network Visualisation of DH2011&#60;/a&#62; which could be used to generate some useful stats, such as &#60;a href=&#34;http://dh2011network.stanford.edu/acercaDe.html&#34;&#62;where everyone who came to DH2011 came from&#60;/a&#62;.
