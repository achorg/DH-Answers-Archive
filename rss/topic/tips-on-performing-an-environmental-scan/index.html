			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is an issue I have come up against on several occasions recently with metadata standards, particularly linked data ontologies.  My first instinct is to use standards that already exist rather than creating my own ontology to describe concepts.  RDF is so open-ended and flexible that there are an infinite number of ways to do anything, and ontologies are often poorly published.  It would be great if there was a single location that indexed ontologies and metadata standards, making it easier to choose one that suits my needs.  Currently I use Google and ask code4lib.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

Arno, I just saw this â€” thank you, that's very helpful. Do you think enough people are even citing enough digital resources to make that technique useful? Maybe they are! I'll have to give that a shot. I love your idea, too, of searching through the ADHO conference abstracts. Definitely using that one!&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This definitely is a hard task for someone new to DH (and even those with a lot of DH experience, if the disciplinary leap is large). You've already mentioned a lot of excellent places to look. Two other places to include in this list might be the NEH's own &#60;a href=&#34;https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx&#34;&#62;database of past grant awards&#60;/a&#62; and the ADHO &#60;a href=&#34;http://67.207.129.15:8080/dh-abstracts/search&#34;&#62;database of past DH conference abstracts&#60;/a&#62; where such tools &#38;amp; resources could have been presented (with the not insignificant benefit of additional context).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I wonder though, if in the end, it might not be necessary to also approach this problem orthogonally, and search for citations &#38;amp; references to digital tools &#38;amp; resources in full text academic publication databases such as WorldCat or Google Scholar. That way you can see (with caveats, obviously) who is citing and using a resource. These will likely be the more established, respected and widely-used digital resources - precisely the kinds of resources (I am assuming) one would not want to inadvertently overlook. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The biggest difficulty I have with projects such as arts-humanities.net or Bamboo DiRT is that in their perfectly understandable, even necessary, desire to categorize the many available resources on the internet they flatten out and over-simplify the reasons that led to a tool or resource being used (or not used) by teachers/researchers or use categories that are predominantly technical and not closely linked to specific disciplinary practice. In addition, the best tools, which often end up being the best documented tools (via manuals, blog entries, screencasts, howtos, blog entries, reviews..etc) catalog themselves, via Google. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So sure, I'd have the students look at DiRT, at arts-humanities.net and the grant and conference databases, but if possible, I'd also combine this with an attempt to find out what researchers are talking about, what's being cited, what's being used - and try to discover this by deliberately looking in venues that track traditional modes of publication.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

This may be more circular than helpful, but we're working on integrating DHCommons and Bamboo DiRT so that projects that use a given tool appear on that tool's profile in DiRT, and information about the tools (pulled from DiRT) is available when you're browsing DHCommons projects by tool. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, if there's ways we could improve either DHCommons and/or Bamboo DiRT to make it easier for for people to conduct an environmental scan, please let us know.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Those of you who have initiated DH projects are, I'm sure, familiar with the environmental scan, in which one surveys existing projects, both to make sure someone hasn't already done what you're about to do and to see if others have developed technology on which you might build. It's a big part of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/digitalhumanitiesstartup.html#howto&#34;&#62;NEH Office of Digital Humanities start-up grants&#60;/a&#62; (as well as just generally good practice).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;At UCLA, we've been asking our grad students to do environmental scans as part of their final projects, and I've noticed that this can pose a challenge for some of them. Here are the challenges, as I see them:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Students have trouble surveying projects outside their home discipline (e.g., art history projects that may be relevant to students in literature).&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Before they've embarked on the &#34;building&#34; part of their projects, students have trouble understanding what kinds of technology might be relevant to what they're doing (e.g., understanding that what they're about to do is a network visualization).&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;The number of potentially relevant projects is overwhelming.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm thinking of ways I can help them overcome these challenges. So far, this is what I've come up with:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Check various directories of projects (e.g., &#60;a href=&#34;http://arts-humanities.net/project&#34;&#62;arts-humanities.net&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://dirt.projectbamboo.org/&#34;&#62;DiRT&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://spatial.scholarslab.org/&#34;&#62;Spatial Humanities&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org/&#34;&#62;DH Commons&#60;/a&#62;). Still, this can be confusing, because it can be hard for students to tell what they should be looking for.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Ask! Tweet, ask at DH Answers, ask me, ask librarians. However, when the project is in its infancy, it can be difficult for them to articulate it to others.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Those of you who have completed many projects: Do you have an informal checklist that you run through when you embark on something new? What else might I tell these students?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
