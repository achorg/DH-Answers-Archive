			<description>&#60;p&#62;Want to add an update to Patrick's update from six months ago, the procedures for exporting item data from an Omeka.net site for import into a self-hosted Omeka site can be found here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://info.omeka.net/manage-an-account/expiration-and-renewal/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://info.omeka.net/manage-an-account/expiration-and-renewal/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also want to emphasize that this export provides you with a CSV file that contains item metadata and links to your files for importing into another Omeka site. Exhibits and pages have to be replicated by hand, there is no export of any plugin-related data.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Just an update -- we're pretty sure that we have things in place to do an export from Omeka.net to an Omeka.org site. However, because of the cost factors of downloading an entire site, it's something that should only be a one-time thing, when you have things set up and are sure you want to make the switch.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;seems like a great opportunity for a new plugin ;-)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The process Sheila's describing would involve getting directly to your database to upload that tables, usually through a tool like phpMyAdmin, which is pretty standard on most hosting services. It would also call for making sure that the archive files, etc. get moved to the correct location on your server. Usually that happens with a tool like FireFTP or another FTP tool.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We can help with sorting those details out, too.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Katy, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To clarify, the zip files can't be uploaded to your Omeka site like you would upload a jpg to attach to an item.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We will give you the ability to transfer your .Net website to a server of your choice by providing a zip with a MySQL dump of the site's database, and a copy of the Omeka installation, including the archive (files, theme uploads, image derivatives), themes, and plugins.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Sheila Brennan's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/can-you-migrate-omekanet-content-into-omekaorg#post-1150&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So just to clarify, I can have the Omeka.net team move the items and the corresponding metadata through a zip which can then be uploaded into Omeka.org?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Currently, there is not a way for Omeka.net site owners to export all of their data in one click. For now you can contact the Omeka Team and they will provide zips of the database and the installation for you to install wherever you please. &#60;a href=&#34;http://help.omeka.net/contact/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://help.omeka.net/contact/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Another option is that if you have a plan that includes the OAI-PMH Repository plugin, you can harvest your archive (although no files or exhibits transfer with that protocol).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am going to be building an Omeka.org site and was wondering if I can transfer my Omeka.net data directly into it? Does anyone know what steps can be done to migrate data? Are there any guides?
