			<description>&#60;p&#62;This autumn I will be teaching an Introduction to DH to a group of masters students with some background in museum informatics. They are non-English speaking students and there is little motivation for them to read academic papers in English (we are based in Siberia). This might mean that examples of scholarly argumentation and DH scholarship should be taken from visualised/non-linear projects, such as GIS, museum web sites with developed browsing opportunities, timelines, etc. I would be appreciative if somebody could refer me to such projects and/or for recommendations or best practices of teaching an academic course without relying too much on reading assignments. It would be even interesting to build a syllabus based on visualisations and non-linear narratives. This would turn our weakness into an opportunity.
