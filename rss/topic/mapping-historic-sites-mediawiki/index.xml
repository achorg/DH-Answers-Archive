			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Kaia,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As far as I know you won't find a wiki solution to this because wikis are just webpages. In order to do what you are doing, you would need to transition to a database solution. I would recommend an &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/&#34;&#62;Omeka&#60;/a&#62;/&#60;a href=&#34;http://neatline.org/&#34;&#62;Neatline&#60;/a&#62; combo. You will be able to use 'items' to make the nuanced distinctions you want to make. Omeka/Neatline is of course not the only option available to you. Another solution would be to build your maps separate from your encyclopedic compendium, using links to connect them back and forth. Hope that helps.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're working on a wiki for our local history, and my dream is to come up with a feature to help sort out mapping questions - if some citation says something was one door south of something else (in 1960) it can be quite difficult to unpack what the address (or general location even) actually was. In my ideal world, each business could have its own article, with a field for the address, and the end result could be a map that would show each article with an address. There are, of course, cases where addresses have changed as buildings have been torn down and rebuilt, split into two, combined, etc., but a map view would seem to make some of that matter less.&#60;br /&#62;
How would I go about this? Is it possible, or am I dreaming? The maps extensions for MediaWiki I've look at seem to be geared toward displaying maps on article pages.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
