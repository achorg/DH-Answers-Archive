			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Alice Stratton's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/methodsideas-for-teaching-hypertext-theory#post-556&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Adding to the reading list @&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/unsworth'&#62;unsworth&#60;/a&#62; started: Theodor Nelson is useful, particularly his Literary Machines (1963) and &#34;Complex Information Processing: A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing and the Indeterminate&#34; (Proceedings of the 20th National Conference of the Association for Computing Machinery. Cleveland, OH: ACM, 1965.) &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For an exercise, you might ask your students to think about hypertext as a concept separate from the digital.  One of my favorite graduate school exercises, in a hypertext writing course, was to create a hypertext in the physical world, somewhere on the university campus. That yielded some fantastically creative stuff.

&#60;p&#62;A text that I've found useful in teaching hypertext theory (now fairly venerable, I guess, but still surprisingly useful), is Greg Ulmer's Heuretics (&#60;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/dwQiR7)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://amzn.to/dwQiR7)&#60;/a&#62;.  While we're on vintage texts, I've also always liked Espen Aarseth's Cybertext (&#60;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/baM8E5)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://amzn.to/baM8E5)&#60;/a&#62;.  Two golden oldies...

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sure thing (in retrospect I can see that my initial post was far too general- sorry about that!)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Just to give a little bit of back story- I'm based in Australia where the rapid growth of the online population here has resulted in an ingenuity gap of sorts within the advertising industry.  Often it is buyers/creatives from other media specialisations who are implementing online campaigns and they are bringing years of acculturation within print and broadcast media with them.  As a result, we see things like 30 second TVCs being used as video pre-rolls and re-appropriated magazines ads (sometimes non-clickable) being slapped across websites.  Yuck!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I follow Adrian Miles' thinking that hypertext literacy is a problem of both reading and writing.  In completing the program I hope that students will feel confident in both practices based on a sound understanding of the basic properties that help define hypertext (i.e. nodes, linkages, multi-linearity, acentredness etc.).  The theoretical concepts to be covered will only be at a beginner type level but I hope to equip students with the tools to continue their learning outside of the classroom (such as teaching them to set up and maintain research blogs and using RSS to keep across industry and technology developments).  I also want to encourage them to apply theoretical concepts to the challenges they will face in everyday professional life.    &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm currently investigating teaching practises that others have used while tackling Hypertext with students but have found surprisingly little on the subject (other than the two previously mentioned examples).  Any ideas/suggestions?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Alice, that's a very exciting program!  Could you say a little bit more about what it is you want to teach?  What aspects of hypertext theory, of thinking, etc. do you want your students to discover?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm currently working on a hypertext introductory program for advertising students.  I'm trying to steer clear of vertical transmission mode of teaching in favour of a more practise-focused, self-directed approach. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far I've found the teaching notes of Adrian Miles (&#60;a href=&#34;http://vogmae.net.au/research/thinking/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://vogmae.net.au/research/thinking/&#60;/a&#62;) and &#34;The Future of Learning&#34; (&#60;a href=&#34;http://startl.org/about/the-future-of-learning/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://startl.org/about/the-future-of-learning/&#60;/a&#62;) to be really useful.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have any recommended texts, thoughts, exercises or tips on how to go about this?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks guys!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
