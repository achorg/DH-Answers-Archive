			<description>&#60;p&#62;The documentation and training materials out there for Drupal aren't generally written with scholarly projects in mind, but it's been a good fit for a lot of projects I've worked with. We're encouraging a lot of people to use it for their projects at Berkeley. I'm working on a book on Drupal for humanists, and am interested in feedback on the draft chapters. If you want to check it out, drop me a note (&#60;a href=&#34;http://quinndombrowski.com/contact)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://quinndombrowski.com/contact)&#60;/a&#62;.

&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the reply. I will have a look at Drupal. I am really still looking at possibilities for the project. It will start as online curation and I am looking to develop other aspects over time. It is basically a historical project.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The web services I think of immediately are all tied closely to particular projects. I don't know if it'd work for your assignment, but you could spin up a Drupal site and install and configure the Services module (&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.drupal.org/project/services)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.drupal.org/project/services)&#60;/a&#62;. I use that for APIs for multiple DH projects.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I need to deploy a web service for an assignment but I am finding it hard to find examples which are relevant to Digital Humanities. If anyone could give me some examples or point me to a list if such exists that would be great. Thanks.
