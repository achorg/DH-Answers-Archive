			<description>&#60;p&#62;Micah - absolutely.  It will probably be available on the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative website (which the fellowhip program is a part of).  The CHI Initiative hasn't launched yet, but when it does, its resources will be available to anyone.  Stay tuned for new on the launch (the CHI Initiative can be followed on Twitter at @chi_initiative)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Ethan, Will this list be available to non-fellows also? i'd be interested in &#34;hacking&#34; my own path through a reading list like this. Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Ethan,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You may want to check out the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities_education/items/collection/2944588&#34;&#62;&#34;DH Assigned Readings&#34;&#60;/a&#62; collection in the Digital Humanities Education library on Zotero.  Along with other members of the group, I'm building a collection of books, articles and reports that appear on DH syllabi.  Readings that might be relevant for the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative include A Companion to Digital Humanities, Digital History, and the ACLS cyberinfrastructure report.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;I forgot to mention that most of the SCI reports are on the list already (how couldn't they be!)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;On the &#34;10,000-foot-view&#34; front, you might look at past reports of the Mellon-funded Scholarly Communication Institute (SCI), which is held annually at UVa, (Full disclosure: I'm Associate Director!) &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The reports detail 3 days of conversation by scholars, librarians, publishers, and higher ed administrators around certain disciplines or themes, in the context of scholarly communication and its digital transformation. The 8th report, on new and experimental publishing models, will be out very soon -- but the past seven are online, here:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.uvasci.org/archive/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.uvasci.org/archive/&#60;/a&#62; &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;They cover areas like Visual Studies, Practical Ethics, the Digital Humanities ('05), Spatial Tech, Architectural History, and the role of centers (DH &#38;amp; otherwise) as infrastructure.  There are executive summaries, too.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're in the process of launching the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative at Michigan State University. the initiative is essentially a platform for supporting &#38;amp; encouraging cultural heritage informatics in the MSU community (and beyond). One of the big components of the initiative is a fellowship program. Essentially the program will allow grad students (both MA and PhD - in a wide variety of programs) to work on a project over the course of a year - the whole &#34;hacking/building as a way of knowing/learning&#34; thing.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;These fellows will most likely have very little digital experience.  So, I'm looking for a base list of publications/reports/resources that they can dive into in order to give them a kick start in the domain.  These pubs/reports/resources are intended to provide a snapshot of what is out there, what is possible, innovative implementations across a broad variety of domains/systems/platforms/etc.  These could be high level (the 10,000 foot view) or focused on a specific domain or platform (mobile, games, etc,)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm going to include things like the Horizon Report (in its various incarnations) as well as the Smithsonian's various digital reports/plans.  These should be less technical (they will drill into the technical considerations once they decide upon a problem/project/platform that want to work on).  I'm (of course) include a variety of serious game/meaningful pay reports/pubs.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for some additional suggestions for what I should include. Thoughts?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
