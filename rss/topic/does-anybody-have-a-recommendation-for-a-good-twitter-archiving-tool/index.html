			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the tips so far, especially that Google doc, Tad.  We'll do some poking around in the tools listed there.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you have an EPrints repository around, &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.eprints.org/w/Tweepository&#34;&#62;there's a plugin called Tweepository that might help&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Eric Johnson's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/does-anybody-have-a-recommendation-for-a-good-twitter-archiving-tool#post-1708&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There was a session at THATCamp Prime on this topic last weekend, and the general consensus was that there was no silver bullet, but there were a few things that worked well for limited use cases. IIRC, hashtags were one of the trickier cases.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, there were much smarter people in the room than me, and I'm just on here to share the Gdoc link, in hopes that something on it might be of some use to you...&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The archivists at UVA are working to capture the events unfolding around us since President Sullivan was asked to resign, and they/we have been using &#60;a href=&#34;http://mashe.hawksey.info/2012/01/twitter-archive-tagsv3/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mashe.hawksey.info/2012/01/twitter-archive-tagsv3/&#60;/a&#62; to capture tweets with various hashtags related to the incident (e.g. #uva, #sullivan, etc.).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;However, that's proving a little unstable, so we wondered if anybody has another solution that they really like to employ.  We're specifically shooting for one that can run on its own, not requiring manual triggers or manual archiving of results.  Alas for poor Twapper Keeper.  Thanks!
