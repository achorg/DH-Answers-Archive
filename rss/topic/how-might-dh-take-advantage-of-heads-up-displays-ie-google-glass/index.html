			<description>&#60;p&#62;Seems to me Google Glass Apps will build upon the &#34;Augmented Reality&#34; tools that people have been tinkering with on smart phones for a few years now.  This is often used to augment trips to cities or museums.  Here's an iPhone app for historical Edinburgh and a list to virtual cities projects collected by a UNC class.&#60;br /&#62;
I'm going to a wedding in Scotland this month, will have to try it out and report!&#60;br /&#62;

&#34;A JISC funded iPhone App that lets visitors to Edinburgh walk over historical maps. The maps are provided by Landmark Information Group and the National Library of Scotland. The software was developed by Edinburgh College of Art, University of Edinburgh. Historical tours were provided with the kind assistance of Edinburgh World Heritage and Margaret Stewart.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Virtual Cities projects - &#60;a href=&#34;http://virtualcities.web.unc.edu/projects/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://virtualcities.web.unc.edu/projects/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
&#34;The following list is a working list of “Virtual Cities” projects. This projects and sites on this list range from extensive academic and library projects to one-off journalistic data visualization. The list is long but far from exhaustive–so please feel free to comment with additional sites!&#34;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Greetings all,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've been chosen to participate in Google's beta rollout of their heads up display product Google Glass, and am curious to hear some interesting ideas as to how such technologies might be leveraged to do interesting things in the Digital Humanities (or, in fact, in the Humanities in general). I do have some ideas for what sorts of things might be useful to start building (as does my institution, where foreign language learning is a major educational focus), but I'd be remiss if I didn't pick the brains of people far more creative than me.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) What kinds of apps might a heads up display be best suited for when it comes to education in the Humanities (especially literature, history, and culture)?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2) What kinds of research questions might such a device be able to raise?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;3) The technology behind Google Glass is what they call a Mirror API -- it is based on working with open data APIs and server-side apps that sync with Google's services to send data back and forth to the hardware. For example, one app that's already developed is from the New York Times, that sends various news alerts to glass wearers subscribing to their feeds. Things like weather, anything from social media, etc. are obvious apps that will undoubtedly appear quite quickly, but I'm interested in what kinds of open APIs exist out in the DH world (for raw data, data analysis, etc.) that might be a good fit for the types of interactions that Google Glass offers? What types of data out in the DH world might be in need of building and prepping to make them available to apps like Glass might be fit for?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, if anyone is interested (especially those that tend more towards the programming/tools development arena of DH) in being part of some DH projects that use Google Glass, please feel free to contact me off-list.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Many, many thanks!
