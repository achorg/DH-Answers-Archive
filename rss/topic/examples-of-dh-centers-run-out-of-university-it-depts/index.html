			<description>&#60;p&#62;At the University of Chicago, &#60;a href=&#34;http://humanities.uchicago.edu/facultystaff/#humcomp&#34;&#62;Humanities Computing&#60;/a&#62; has primary responsibility for supporting faculty DH research in the graduate division of the Humanities. It also provides divisional staff with administrative IT services and personalized desktop support to both staff and faculty. In many ways, it's a classic, central IT unit but unlike your example it reports to and is funded by the humanities division. I ran this unit (as its first director) from 2005-2010. In 2010 I wrote up a long email describing the unit which also enters into the questions you've raised above for Martin Wynne at Oxford. I'd be happy to share that with you if you like. But for a more current overview, you should contact its current director, Michael Wills (mwills@uchicago.edu).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for examples of Digital Humanities centers run out of, or primarily supported through, university information technology departments (the folks who would normally run desktop support, set up servers, and who at larger institutions might also support things like grid computing for the sciences). I've just printed out the DH Center Survey that CLIR published in 2008, but that's now four years old and other centers may have come along since its publication.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd also appreciate any experiences you may have had working with University IT, problems or challenges, things they could have done better, etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Dot
