			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @dot.porter's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/virtual-lightbox-or-what-are-some-good-image-comparison-tools#post-2004&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you don't have a lot of support for code modding, should I presume you don't have much infrastructural support as well? This stuff necessitates installing FastCGI on a server, as well as IIPImage Server (&#60;a href=&#34;http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/)&#60;/a&#62;. It can be installed whole hog on a recent-version Ubuntu server relatively easily, but that last phrase's meaning may vary greatly.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If your holdup is in code modding and not infrastructure, I might be able to help with some light modding, as I've done some for my own needs already. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(Belated note that I corresponded about this way back with Joe Padfield at the National Gallery, and he was wonderful to work with.)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for something simple. The VL is set up to automatically load with specified images already there, then you can move them around, zoom in and out, nice for basic comparison. I don't have much support for code modification right now. I'll check out IIPImage!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;What sort of comparisons are you looking to do? And who do you have available for what level of creation or adaptation?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've had some luck with using adaptations of the National Gallery (UK) adaptations of IIPImage, such as &#60;a href=&#34;http://cima.ng-london.org.uk/iip/examples/newcomp.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://cima.ng-london.org.uk/iip/examples/newcomp.html&#60;/a&#62;. Further examples of what they've done are at &#60;a href=&#34;http://research.ng-london.org.uk/wiki/index.php/National_Gallery_IIPImage&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://research.ng-london.org.uk/wiki/index.php/National_Gallery_IIPImage&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for a server-side tool I can use to compare some images. I'm familiar with the Virtual Lightbox at MITH (&#60;a href=&#34;http://mith.umd.edu/lightbox/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mith.umd.edu/lightbox/)&#60;/a&#62;, but according to the site it hasn't been touched since 2004 and I'm wondering if there is anything newer that does the same kind of thing.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
