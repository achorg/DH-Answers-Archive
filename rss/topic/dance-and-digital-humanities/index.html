			<description>&#60;p&#62;Kathy was at the meeting, so she already knows this, but the audio of the first two meetings at NYPL will be placed on the MITH project page (&#60;a href=&#34;http://mith.umd.edu/dance-preservation&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mith.umd.edu/dance-preservation&#60;/a&#62;) soon. If anyone is interested in attending the meeting at the Kennedy Center (probably in March) let me know.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Yes, indeed, Stefan. The folks behind Synchronous Objects at Ohio State University are partnering with MITH on the documentation and preservation of dance project. We'll be having a technical workshop on the subject at Ohio State early in the Winter. Doug Reside is PI-ing this project.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This isn't quite what you were looking for, I think, but I've always loved the &#60;a href=&#34;http://synchronousobjects.osu.edu/&#34;&#62;Synchronous Objects&#60;/a&#62; project for visualizing and studying dance movements.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;MITH will be co-hosting with the Kennedy Center a public forum on the digital documentation and preservation of dance. Date still to be determined, probably in May.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Here's a JISC-funded project that may be of interest:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Dance Teaching Resource &#38;amp; Collaborative engagement Spaces (D-TRACES)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Coventry university&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The D-TRACES Project (Dance teaching resource and collaborative engagement spaces) will exploit a unique and significant digital dance resource, the Siobhan Davies digital archive. Following a systematic analysis of user engagement and impact on the local student experience, the project will develop a model for embedding the digital archive within the Personal Development Planning (PDP) element of the undergraduate dance curriculum at Coventry University, thereby generating learning objects for much wider distribution.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Last year's Nebraska Digital Workshop featured a dancer - Heather Raikes. See her abstract here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://cdrh.unl.edu/opportunities/neb_digital_workshop/archive.php&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://cdrh.unl.edu/opportunities/neb_digital_workshop/archive.php&#60;/a&#62; and her site here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.heatherraikes.com/corpuscorvus/Home.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.heatherraikes.com/corpuscorvus/Home.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I really loved her combination of dance, performance, theory and tech.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @James Neal's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/dance-and-digital-humanities#post-510&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks all! Bethany, that article is tremendously helpful. Someone also privately suggested another: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;“Dance and Technology: A Pas de Deux for Post-Humans by Kent de Spain”&#60;br /&#62;
Dance Research Journal, Vol. 32, No. 1 (Summer, 2000), pp. 2-17&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/stable/1478270&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.jstor.org.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/stable/1478270&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;James, I attended that meeting of scholars (as an archive and digital specialist). Listening to the dance community discuss preservation and future digital collaborations was immensely helpful. Creating Laban annotations using LabanWriter being combined with videos of performance and rehearsal was totally cool. Also, a dream scenario emerged for searchability that doesn't turn dance into text (very important):  someone goes into a booth, makes a movement or gesture and asks for every reference to that movement or gesture to be displayed. Apparently, we might be close to this because of work on motion capture being being done at ACCAD at OSU (&#60;a href=&#34;http://accad.osu.edu)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://accad.osu.edu)&#60;/a&#62;.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As a virtual outsider to the dance community (only an amateur, bad dancer in my youth), it was completely exciting to be involved in the conversation. And with MITH/UMD spearheading the conversations, surely something grand will come out of this.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've already sent a pointer tweet out about this, but you might consider looking through the past years of the papers and presentations of the Digital Resources for the Humanities and Arts (most recently, &#60;a HREF=&#34;http://drha2010.org.uk/&#34;&#62;http://drha2010.org.uk/&#60;/a&#62; from this past September). It is an annual UK conference, but the presenters are global and there were a number of exciting presentations there this year.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For a great example of work in this area, see Jama Coartney and Susan Wiesner in &#60;em&#62;LLC&#60;/em&#62;: &#34;Performance as digital text: Capturing signals and secret messages in a media-rich experience&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/2/153.abstract&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/2/153.abstract&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This paper, which was presented at DH 2008 in Oulu, describes collaborative work among UVa librarians, Engineering faculty and students, and a dance choreographer.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;My first response might have echoes to the &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/doing-dh-v-theorizing-dh&#34;&#62;Doing DH v Theorizing DH&#60;/a&#62; discussion in that it aims toward the pedagogical side that is (sometimes) seen as being under the DH umbrella.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you count public blogging about a class as part of DH (itself a performance), then that's one way to go at it. We had an experience here a few years ago in which a student in theatre was blogging about her difficulty in how to direct a particular scene of a play. A few days later, the playwright commented on the post. It was a really powerful moment for the student.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And, I've worked with one professor who is taking public domain video and audio from Internet Archives to have students create a soundtrack to a video.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For other facets of DH, I can definitely see the difficulty in talking about performance art . . . harder to mine data from a performance than from a text!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, here's the kind of idea that I would throw out, as one example of how performance art and DH could mix:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Given that so much of new media is (re)mixing content and media together, there might be rich ground for combining live performance with how people currently do mashups? That is, a mashup of both live and digital?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I think that there are core DH ideas -- new media, remixing content in new ways -- that combine with more traditional performance art lurking in there somewhere.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hope that helps...I'll be interested to see where this conversation goes!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Neat question! Someone to get in touch with might be Doug Rosenberg at the University of Wisconsin at Madison (bias disclosure: that's where I work), editor of the new International Journal of Screendance. Seems to me there's some DH intersection possible there...

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is perhaps a simplistic question, but as I prepare to discuss Digital Humanities with other departments on my campus, the need for articulating the relevance of Digital Humanities to a Dance Department are on my mind.  How have you articulated DH to the performance-based arts? Have you encountered resistance from the Arts in collaborating under the Humanities umbrella? What tools are used for preservation or data mining in the Arts?  ARTeFact comes to mind for dance. Music has &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.diggingintodata.org/Home/AwardRecipients2009/StructuralAnalysisofLargeAmountsofMusic/tabid/179/Default.aspx&#34;&#62;SALAMI&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://music-encoding.org/&#34;&#62;MEI&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(I'm not even sure where this kind of question should be housed on DH Answers.)
