			<description>&#60;p&#62;So the non-UVa and -IU folks understand the context ... the IU Libraries basically wants to use Neatline as a standalone tool.  For the faculty projects in question, all will be using Omeka, but at least two are not relying on the Neatline mapping features at the item level (the monographs, maps, pamphlets) but rather discrete data sets compiled from various sources including those we would feature in an Omeka exhibit. To get around this, which is what's causing the heartache, we need to set up an Omeka collection for essentially data that we would then like to render in Neatline (and not in Omeka proper).  Once we have these initial points plotted, the researchers can then layer the maps with annotations, cross-references, etc.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We were exploring ways that we could streamline the process for batching chunks of geo and temporal data into Neatline with little to no technical wizardry or workarounds to make it happen (i.e., use of existing plugins).  Mostly because we are hoping to establish Map-Based Discovery (digital library) &#34;Services&#34; for which Neatline would feature significantly (at least that's my hope). Obviously, to establish a service model, we need to be able to use existing tools and workflows as much as possible.  However, we don't necessarily expect SLab folks to go and do the work to make this happen!  I do think that in trying to wrangle Neatline in the way we have, we encountered more obstacles than expected, and soon began to realize that we didn't perhaps understand the architecture as well as we thought.  It just so happened that in talking with David McClure, the Neatline crew has already encountered requests for supporting a use case similar to our, and we may have a more elegant solution yet!  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As Brianna and I mentioned to David, we would like to contribute what we can toward this endeavor.  It won't be code-based, but we have compiled lots of parallel documentation (workflows, scenarios, etc.) that I probably too narrowly label &#34;from the library's perspective&#34; that we'd like to share with the broader community and can work with SLab to integrate the relevant bits into Neatline's existing documentation. The community would also benefit greatly by seeing accompanying implementation documentation along with the Neatline &#34;demo&#34;/featured projects.  Perhaps IU could help wrangle existing documentation for a few exemplars?  (I know -- I said that, right?  crazy!).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/profile/bhmarsha'&#62;bhmarsha&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/are-any-libraries-using-neatline#post-2107&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
Hi Brianna, I'm the project manager here in the Scholars' Lab, and I support our faculty Neatline installations. As Bethany said above, we've installed Neatline for about a dozen faculty members for use in their own research and in the classroom, and we're not getting reports of the kinds of issues that you've experienced, but our local use cases are a more in line with the uses originally envisioned for Neatline.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Your use case has created lots of discussion here in the SLab offices, and we've scheduled a formal meeting for next week to sit down together and hash out the next phase of Neatline development here at UVa.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd love to chat further with you about this, and especially to understand where you hit blocks as you started to work with Neatline to figure out how we might mitigate those for other users. You can reach me at rag9b (at) virginia.edu.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks everyone for weighing in!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'll explain a little bit more about what we are doing at IU. We have two faculty projects that seemed ideal for use with Neatline. One is a digital exhibit incorporating book plate images and bibliographic metadata; this would correspond with a physical exhibit currently at our rare books library. The other project focuses on the history of globalization and is a bit more typical: we have spreadsheets of descriptive metadata and geographic coordinates. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Taking on these projects was somewhat of a test run of Omeka/Neatline for DH projects. There is strong interest here at IU about developing a consulting model for others who want to work on similar projects, but our experience so far hasn't really lent itself to developing that structure. We have been having more problems than expected due to a variety of factors - you can check out my forum posts detailing those problems here, if interested: &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/forums/profile/bhmarsha&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://omeka.org/forums/profile/bhmarsha&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;By asking about your problems with/use of Neatline, I was really just trying to see who is engaged with the tool. I would like to pull together three or four case studies of libraries using Neatline for student/faculty projects, plus suggestions for libraries who may want to do this moving forward. I think this would be great to submit to Code4Lib or a similar journal. I would have loved to read something along those lines when I started working with Neatline. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm aiming to pull an article together by mid-spring. My colleague at UNC will be participating. Jean, would your project be a good fit and are you interested in contributing to such an article? Bethany, is there someone in particular at UVa I should reach out to?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We are supporting about a dozen faculty projects using Neatline -- research projects and classroom applications -- here at UVa Library this year. But I know you're in touch with Scholars' Lab folks already, Brianna.  What I'm not sure about is whether you're asking for general experiences using the Neatline plugins or library experiences with installing and maintaining Omeka and GeoServer as well.  (I also know that you guys were initially interested in applying Neatline to library needs pretty far outside of its initial imagined use case, so am curious if that continues.)  Anyway -- this is just an invitation to go into more detail!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We just started a (potentially big) Neatline project at Brown in the Library.  It's in early stages, but so far no Neatline specific problems.  Getting geoserver installed has been our primary hurdle.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I suspect that the folks at Scholars Lab who built it in UVa libraries might have some things going on with it. A good additional place to ask is probably on the &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/forums&#34;&#62;Omeka forums&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My name is Brianna Marshall and I'm a graduate student working as a digital projects research assistant at the Indiana University Libraries. Over the summer, we began exploring Neatline as a platform to facilitate faculty DH projects. We've been in touch with the library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but beyond that we haven't heard much about other libraries using the tool. We've faced a significant number of roadblocks so far in working with Neatline so we definitely think it would be useful to get other libraries' perspectives. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If anyone knows of libraries using Neatline, please let me know! We'll appreciate it. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Brianna
