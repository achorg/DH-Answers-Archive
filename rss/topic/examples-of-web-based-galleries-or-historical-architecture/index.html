			<description>&#60;p&#62;Photogrammetry is great for low-cost architectural/archaeological documentation, but for the type of virtual reality walkthrough exhibited by Williamsburg, the digital Pompeii project at the University of Arkansas, or any of the other projects using Unity, I'd recommend building the 3D models from scratch rather than importing models generated by photogrammetry.  Photogrammetry tends to produce a muddy, higher-polygon-than-necessary result.  It's great for documenting ruins, but not for reconstructions.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Paul,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is actually something I've been kicking for some time. I've had a lot of success modeling extant architecture with photogrammetry, and am a proponent of &#60;a href=&#34;http://ccwu.me/vsfm/&#34;&#62;VisualSfM&#60;/a&#62; (Noah Snavely who does &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/bundler/&#34;&#62;Bundler&#60;/a&#62; highly recommended it). I've also had good success getting models out of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan/standard/&#34;&#62;PhotoScan&#60;/a&#62;, which has a decent user interface for this type of thing. The benefit here is that you can get a textured model out of PhotoScan with a few clicks (and waiting), but you don't have to use additional modeling software to get generate a model. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've seen a lot of people use &#60;a href=&#34;http://unity3d.com/&#34;&#62;Unity&#60;/a&#62; to re-render this for web delivery. This is a technique used by Colonial Williamsburg for their &#60;a href=&#34;http://research.history.org/vw1776/&#34;&#62;Williamsburg 1776&#60;/a&#62; reconstruction of the town during the American Revolution. The down side to this technique (other than being quite resource intensive) is that it requires  a plugin to actually work. I think perhaps a better way to handle this is by leveraging modern browser's capabilities with webGL. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Depending on how &#34;good&#34; you want the render to be, you're going to need to clean the models up in something like 3DStudio Max, Maya, Blender, or any number of other modeling tools. Just a warning, though, if you're new to this kind of software, the learning curve is steep, and the interfaces for these tools take some getting use to.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For web delivery of the models using webGL, there are two main wrappers in major use these days, &#60;a href=&#34;http://threejs.org/&#34;&#62;three.js&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://kineticjs.com/&#34;&#62;kineticjs&#60;/a&#62; (there are others, but these seem to be getting the most traction). Using three.js, the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.chaostoperfection.com/&#34;&#62;Chaos to Perfection&#60;/a&#62; is an amazing interactive &#34;stroll&#34; around Versailles. And the project has an &#60;a href=&#34;http://threejs.org/&#34;&#62;amazing gallery&#60;/a&#62; of example work. For my own work, I've had quite a bit of success with three.js rendering high-poly models quite quickly, but the main issue I've run in to is the fact that a 30Mb texture map still takes a while to download...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For geospatial delivery, I've toyed with a plugin for Omeka that would allow you to add 3D models to items (with an eye toward using them with Neatline). I've been holding off a bit as OpenLayers (the library we use for rendering maps) is going through a major upgrade that will allow you to &#34;easily&#34; tie &#60;a href=&#34;http://cesium.agi.com/&#34;&#62;cesium&#60;/a&#62; to the map, allow you to render terrains (and hopefully models) in 3D without a plugin. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With all that said, here are some other examples of using 3D to help visualize this kind of data:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://mayaarch3d.unm.edu/&#34;&#62;MayaArch&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.kvl.cch.kcl.ac.uk/projects.html&#34;&#62;King's Visualization Lab&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://archive.cyark.org/&#34;&#62;CyArk&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://idialab.org/&#34;&#62;IDIALab&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.byzantium1200.com/index.html&#34;&#62;Byzantium 1200&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dukewired.org/&#34;&#62;Duke Wired&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And, if you're not prone to motion sickness, this is a visualization of 10,000+ images I did of a Spanish Monastery that steps through each image, showing a point cloud, and its shaded and textured surfaces. &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pKOtiQ-ZOI&#34;&#62;Calatrava&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;HTH,&#60;br /&#62;
Wayne

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A colleague of mine has been admiring the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.whatjanesaw.org/&#34;&#62;What Jane Saw&#60;/a&#62; project and has asked for help with an idea for a related immersive web-based gallery based on a historical model. I'm wondering if anyone can recommend similar sites that model gallery spaces or that use architectural models for site navigation and display. (And not Second Life.) There must be great architectural projects and museum sites out there that do this. Grateful for your suggestions.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We're also interested in suggestions for what kinds of platforms or software would be most useful for creating such a web-based project: making an architectural model, overlaying images, providing some kind of spatial navigation, etc. (It seems that What Jane Saw is built from SketchUp models, rendered into background images, and serving room and picture info with PHP and JavaScript.) What approaches would you recommend or avoid? Thanks for your time --
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
