			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am looking for models and best practices to ensure long term sustainability of a collaborative DH project. Could you please point me to long running DH projects whose protocols for governance, editorial oversight, institutional ownership/hosting I might emulate? I am thinking of medium sized DH projects as models, so bigger than one scholar publishing a digital project, but smaller than the TEI consortium or Jstor. Something the size of Nines or another project that has multiple contributors and a focused but regular scholarly user base.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Given the concerns over sustainability inherent in DH, I am also interested in thoughts and advice on how to transition a project from the stage where a grant-funded PI is the leader in getting content online to where an editorial board (and institutional hosts) maintain a project longer term. Also, how do DH projects handle the preservation of content for such a project? The data will be licensed open source, but who should hold the copyright after the project is launched? A university library, an s-corporation independent of any institution (like some non-profit scholarly journals or professional societies), the public domain, the original scholarly contributors?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Please provide links to governance structures and legal arrangement of existing projects if you are aware of them.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
