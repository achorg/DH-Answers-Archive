			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd recommend taking a look at DH education programs like &#60;a href=&#34;http://praxis.scholarslab.org/&#34;&#62;Praxis&#60;/a&#62; at the Scholars' Lab that stand outside of departmental affiliation.  I think this is a better approach than a graduate degree in digital humanities.  Call me old fashioned, but I believe so-called digital humanists should still be trained in traditional research methods.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am a doctoral student at the University of Victoria, and we just approved DH as a Major Field within the English PhD (I just took the comprehensive exam in it). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Various folks (Ray Siemens and some others) are currently developing a graduate certificate, likely tying in with credit for coursework at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, the Oxford Summer School, etc. We're also working on an undergraduate minor, I think, although I'm not sure. I know there is a formal undergraduate program in the works of some sort, but I can't remember the specifics. We currently have a series of four DH-ish undergraduate courses housed within the School of Arts &#38;amp; Humanities (not within any specific department, but as free floating, unattached courses). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A lot of this, at our institution at least, is being driven by graduate student &#38;amp; undergraduate student pressure and what they seem to want.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If any more come to mind, I will pipe up. :)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Nebraska also offers a graduate certificate in DH.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There's the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ois.ualberta.ca/en/HumanitiesComputing.aspx&#34;&#62;MA at UAlberta&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/courses/mamsc&#34;&#62;MA and PhD at UCL&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Edit: Whoops, you were asking about programs which are in the works. I'm not positive of any, though I think Alberta was working on a PhD.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You may know this, but UCLA offers a &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cdh.ucla.edu/instruction/dhgradcertprog.html&#34;&#62;graduate certificate in DH&#60;/a&#62;.

&#60;p&#62;I suspect you know about King's College already, but just in case, here's the link! They offer both MA and PhD.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working with a group at UNC-Chapel Hill on DH-related educational initiatives and we're pulling together an environmental scan of graduate level digital humanities programs--PhD, MA, certificates. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Past posts on DH Q&#38;amp;A have been great at pointing me toward established programs, but now I'm wondering if there are other graduate level programs in the works? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd also be interested in hearing about programs that allow humanities PhD students to substitute tech skills, research methodologies, etc. for foreign languages requirements as well as PhD programs that incorporate DH training in other ways---perhaps as a minor field, etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Cheers,&#60;br /&#62;
