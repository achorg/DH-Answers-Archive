			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi all, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One of our faculty wants to use text-mining to engage in some kind of personality analysis of 19th-century literary characters. Here's what they said about the project: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am a faculty member in psychology and, along with Professor Reed in English, I am embarking on a project in which we are combining personality theory and fictional characters.  Im not sure what is possible digitally, but we hope to be able to scan fictional texts for a variety of words, phrases, descriptors and the like which will give us clues about the ways in which authors apply various conceptions of personality and theory of mind.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It seems to me this is a pretty simple text-mining project that could possibly be done with either Voyeur or WordSeer. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
