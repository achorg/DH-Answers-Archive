			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is the subject of a lot of my current research. The suggestions above are good places to start. I would add the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.juxtasoftware.org/&#34;&#62;Juxta&#60;/a&#62; tool to the mix. Like Ridolfo's, this is a DIFF solution. With texts where the traces are minor or have been moved around, the DIFF breaks down. At the moment we are working with an open source plagiarism detector that will run on a 64-bit Linux machine: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mediastandardstrust/superfastmatch&#34;&#62;SuperFastMatch&#60;/a&#62;. There is no easy web solution yet because of the nature of the computation. The SuperFastMatch library needs all resources in one PC for example. Hope this helps.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hmm. For 1a) you should be able to use the Unix/Linux/OS X terminal tool diff to compare the files. For 1b) you might be able to import the texts into SQL and then do something more complex with mysqldiff. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For 2) you might want to contact MATRIX re: this project: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/2009/12/digging-into-data-challenge-grant-awarded-to-matrix/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/2009/12/digging-into-data-challenge-grant-awarded-to-matrix/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You may find this article on sequence alignment in large text corpora by the folks at ARTFL (&#60;a href=&#34;http://artfl-project.uchicago.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://artfl-project.uchicago.edu/&#60;/a&#62;) useful &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/190/235&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/190/235&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The software ARTFL uses is freely available but its set-up and use remains fairly challenging and has a steep learning curve. Still, the ARTFL team is nothing if not friendly and would, I'm sure, be willing to jump in and assist if you think their tools would be of use for your project as well.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I want to do two different sorts of text comparison, though I suspect the answer for one will apply for the other. Ideally, I'll find a web-based or freeware solution to one or both of the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1. I want to see how much of an early text (a published article, in this case) was lifted and republished in a later one (a book chapter). Being able to find verbatim reuse of paragraphs, sentences, or even strings of words (&#38;gt;5 or so) would be very useful. Both texts have already been identified (i.e. I don't need to search across texts to find candidates for comparison - though that would be nice for the future!), and the ultimate goal is to highlight, in the more recent text, those portions that came from the earlier one. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A side interest (which seems like it would follow from the above) would be to find moments were specific words, examples, or references were swapped out for others. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2. Expanding on the former, I'd like to be able to take the entire set of texts by a given author published before a certain date and find, as before, portions lifted and republished in a text published on that date (a large book, known to have been cobbled together from previous work, for which the MS is unknown and so finding provenance of various passages has proven laborious). Corpus size is obviously larger here, and representing/listing the relevant portions of lifted text is more complicated because they would each be tagged, ideally, as belonging to specific prior texts. Generating a list of passages from the recent text that listed (a) their location in the new text, (b) the earlier text in which they appeared, and (c) their location in the earlier text would be ideal.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any idea?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Note #1: All the relevant texts are pre-1923 and available in relatively-clean text files (or can be turned into them).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Note #2: I poked around before posting â€“ the closest thread I found is &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-way-to-display-and-compare-multiple-editions-of-a-songbook-on-the-web#post-1224http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-way-to-display-and-compare-multiple-editions-of-a-songbook-on-the-web#post-1224&#34;&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;, though the focus there is music notation.
