			<description>&#60;p&#62;+1 for Evernote, Scrivener, and OmniFocus. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For word processing, I find that &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.redlers.com/mellel.html&#34;&#62;Mellel&#60;/a&#62; is better at doing what I want than NeoOffice, OpenOffice, or (gack) Word. I also use &#60;a href=&#34;http://sonnysoftware.com/&#34;&#62;Bookends&#60;/a&#62;, a bibliography manager that sells at a special package-deal price with Mellel. Bookends isn't perfect by any means, but Mellel is so good that I'm willing to keep Bookends around.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I also like Ugo Landini's &#60;a href=&#34;http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/&#34;&#62;Pomodoro&#60;/a&#62; timer app for time management, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dejal.com/timeout/&#34;&#62;Time Out&#60;/a&#62; to remind me to stand up and stretch so I don't hurt my hands, and &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.red-sweater.com/flextime/&#34;&#62;FlexTime&#60;/a&#62; for structuring my time in routines more complex than Pomodoro will support.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have iShowU HD for screen capture on my iMac.  Also, because I do virtual world stuff, Phoenix Viewer (which replaced the beloved Emerald Viewer since the &#34;scandal&#34;).  There's my World of Warcaft folder, which is huge and takes up a lot of space--and initially I went there to do research, but now, I just play a lot.  Dreamweaver for website management/design, Kindle for Mac, and Stickies (which I use a lot). Someone mentioned GraphicConverter and I cannot say enough good things about that venerable piece of shareware.  I wish it just had a few more editing plug-ins, and I'd never need Photoshop or Gimp again.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the tips. I use Mac OS X and would like to make a plug for a few not mentioned yet. I use these handy tools every day, and probably every hour!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;-- &#60;a href=&#34;http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/&#34;&#62;Jumpcut&#60;/a&#62; (a clipboard buffering tool--easily access a list of text clips recently copied to your clipboard)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;-- &#60;a href=&#34;http://amarsagoo.info/namely/&#34;&#62;Namely&#60;/a&#62; (quick way to open applications on the Mac; a hotkey invokes a pane that you can use to search for apps--works *much* faster than Spotlight for application opening, and it learns from what you use most often)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;-- For notetaking, &#60;a href=&#34;http://simplenoteapp.com/&#34;&#62;Simplenote&#60;/a&#62; paired with &#60;a href=&#34;http://notational.net/&#34;&#62;Notational Velocity&#60;/a&#62; (it really is a &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tuaw.com/2010/02/19/notational-velocity-simplenote-and-dropbox-bring-child-like-wo/&#34;&#62;game changer&#60;/a&#62;)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'll recommend DevonThink Pro Office.  Combine this with a ScanSnap scanner and you have paperless office solution.  DTPro does OCR (using AbbyFineReader software) as it pulls in the scanned items, then offers full-text searching.  Mac only.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Another Devon Technologies product, DevonAgent, is a very useful desktop federated search engine that I use all the time. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;devon-technologies.com
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;+1 for &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.evernote.com/&#34;&#62;Evernote&#60;/a&#62; -- I travel a lot and have been creating folders in it where I drop all of my logistical stuff, so that I can access it from my phone and iPad -- train and plane tickets, hotel reservation confirmations, the paper I'm going to give, conference programs -- and I even snap a picture of where I parked my car at the airport.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And a couple of Mac-only tools that others might not mention:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/&#34;&#62;Omnigraffle&#60;/a&#62;: UML diagrams, org charts, quick-and-dirty wireframes. Mostly, lately, org charts.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For distraction-free writing, when I really, really need them: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom&#34;&#62;WriteRoom&#60;/a&#62; and its twee cousin, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ommwriter.com/&#34;&#62;Ommwriter&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tweetdeck.com/&#34;&#62;Tweetdeck&#60;/a&#62; is still my Twitter client when I'm on my laptop.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And I use &#60;a href=&#34;http://macromates.com/&#34;&#62;TextMate&#60;/a&#62; just like you do, St√©fan, for most code &#38;amp; plain-text editing, or any quick note-jotting.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Cool stuff I use on my Mac (and not listed above): &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;ArgoUML: UML editor with code stub generation in many languages&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Emacs: Fastest coding environment, plus it has a psychoanalyst built in as an easter egg.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Evernote - Cool because when I use my iPad, my notes are there.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Firefox 4 beta (Firebug 1.7 works in it, so I switched&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;GitX (visualize git commits)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Internet Explorere 6 (runs through Wine; sometimes useful)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Jing (just in case I need to make a screencast)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;MAMP (PHP in OS X is a pain)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Macfusion (makes mounting ssh file systems a breeze)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;MATLAB - Yes, I use this...&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;MySQL Administrator, Query Browser, and MySQLWorkbench (nice tools for working with MySQL databases)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Nambu - awesome twitter client&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Netbeans - IDE I use mostly for PHP&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;OpenProj - FOSS project management&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;oxYgen - Sometimes you need a gorilla&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;ParaView and VisIt - 3D visualization tools for large datasets&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;pgAdmin - GUI for working with Postgresql&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;rvm - Ruby version manager makes Ruby development easier (run multiple versions of ruby as well as switching between sets of gems to avoid collisions)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Selenium (automate browser testing)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Skipfish (Google's security scanner)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Transmission (seriously, it's for downloading Linux distos...)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Vidalia (nice Tor client)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Vim&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Unity (nice 3D editor with in-browser support)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;VMWare (when I need to test something before I request a &#34;real&#34; VM from our sysops)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;ZenMap (security scanning)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm on a Mac and use a lot of the tools that have been mentioned already: Coda, Echofon (which &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ryancordell&#34;&#62;Ryan Cordell&#60;/a&#62; turned &#60;em&#62;me&#60;/em&#62; onto at this year's NEH-sponsored Geospatial Institute at UVa), Firefox (love the search shortcuts, which &#60;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Speed-Up-Your-Searching-in/23105/&#34;&#62;I wrote about at ProfHacker&#60;/a&#62;), Dropbox, Keynote, and more. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Other tools that I find daily use for include:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;AntiSocial, Freedom, and/or SelfControl: for cutting me off from the Internet when I need it &#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;EndNote X4: I really like Zotero, but I've spent so much time with EndNote (for my dissertation and all my grad work before that) that upon revisiting it this year, it just felt right.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Caffeine: a small menu-bar plugin recommended by &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/acavender&#34;&#62;Amy Cavender&#60;/a&#62; that lets me keep my computer running when I need it. &#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Clips: my preferred clipboard tool for OS X&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Camtasia: Since a lot of the DH work I do is pedagogical, I like this tool for making quick screencasts for others.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Skitch: it's simplistic, but it's hard to beat it for quick screenshots, marking them up, and sharing them with others.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;WriteRoom: This super simple word processor allows me to focus on just the words getting onto the page.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I use a Mac as well, but I have a FreeBSD server for development work.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On my Mac, I tend to use Chrome for most of my browsing and FireFox for WebCT/Blackboard since they target a small number of browsers.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm on a Mac! As such, here are some of the apps I use that haven't been mentioned yet:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Coda is my newly re-acquainted (after a several-year hiatus) favorite web editing app.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Echofon for Twitter, which I use extensively for work-related purposes; thanks to Brian Croxall for the impetus to check it out.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;GraphicConverter for fast conversion of images from one type to another. &#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Quicksilver for all kinds of keyboard shortcuts.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Things for to-do list keeping.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;VUE (Visual Understanding Environment) and CMap Tools for mind mapping.&#60;/li&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I always find this question kind of fascinating. Have you ever seen &#60;a href=&#34;http://usesthis.com/&#34;&#62;The Setup&#60;/a&#62;, interviews with developers (etc) on their hardware/software? (That by way of &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/nirak&#34;&#62;@nirak&#60;/a&#62; on twitter.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm on Linux, so I often have a bit of Mac envy w/r/t to some of the great software. I use OpenOffice almost exclusively, though once in a while a document with really specific formatting needs (say, a CV) drives me to Word (yeah, I know I could just do it in LaTeX... I've tried; it was ugly).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I do want to share one piece of software which I'm falling in love with: emacs's &#60;a href=&#34;http://orgmode.org/&#34;&#62;org-mode&#60;/a&#62;. I'm only a relative newcomer to emacs itself. The key bindings take some getting used to. But I now find myself C-c C-y'ing instead of Ctrl-V'ing when I go to paste stuff in OpenOffice. It does all the things I ask of it, and much much more. There's a &#60;a href=&#34;http://github.com/omouse/processing-emacs&#34;&#62;processing-mode&#60;/a&#62; that works pretty well too. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Org-mode, which was featured on the &#60;a href=&#34;http://twit.tv/floss136&#34;&#62;FLOSS Weekly&#60;/a&#62; podcast recently, is great tool for keeping tracks of notes, to-do lists, and other things. There is a bit of learning curve (which I am still ascending slowly), but it is easy and stores everything in plain text. By keeping all my .org files in a folder sync'd by Dropbox, I have access to my notes everywhere. It is an emacs mode, so you have to commit to all the idiosyncrasies of emacs. But I think I've made a life choice to cast my lot with emacs as my text editor of choice for my adulthood. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(Also, if you're tinkering with Linux, I'm beginning to really like the &#60;a href=&#34;http://awesome.naquadah.org/&#34;&#62;awesome&#60;/a&#62; window manager as an alternative to Gnome/KDE. It's not flashy. But it gets the job done and is kind on system resources.)

&#60;p&#62;That's a good list, St√©fan.  I use many of the same.  I also use Gimp fairly often (it is a freeware program sort of like Photoshop).  I'm not a power user, but it works great for quick image rescaling, editing, and format conversion.  I also use Jungle Disk to mount a remote drive in the cloud for backup and such.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A bit of voyeurism on this Sunday evening: there's no shortage of opinions on best applications out there (and @ProfHacker often has great suggestions), but I'm curious what my DH colleagues and friends commonly use as apps. This question was initially motivated by my continued flirting with Linux (and a desire to bootstrap my knowledge of useful stuff), but I'd suggest the net be cast across platforms. Here are a few of applications I use most often with some very subjective commentary:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Firefox&#60;/strong&#62; I know a lot of people complain that it's slow, but I actually haven't found that, maybe because I have a ton of RAM (that's not to say that Javascript intensive sites run as fast as they do in Chrome, but for the vast majority of sites I don't see a difference). I've also ported by profile between machines so many times that I'm very comfortable that I won't lose things (whereas the profile situation for Chrome on Mac is much less clear to me) ‚Äì I think both Firefox and Chrome are moving to synchronized profiles, so that may be less of an issue in the future. I also still prefer Firefox's location bar and its suggestions, and I also find Firefox on the whole more customizable. I mostly use Firebug and Zotero for extensions (plus a couple more)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Thunderbird&#60;/strong&#62; I've actually just shifted back to TBird from Apple Mail ‚Äì I like the UI of Mail, but the lack of good shortcuts drives me insane (you can set keyboard shortcuts in system preference for individual apps, but I find them flaky). I've also just now installed Lightning for calendars and I really like how it's integrated into my mail screen&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Eclipse&#60;/strong&#62; Yep, I love it for just about all the coding I do: Java, XML, PHP, Javascript, Ruby, Python, etc. I really like the team plugins (SVN and Git)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Textmate&#60;/strong&#62; I can't quite explain why, but I usually come back to Textmate for very quick editing, either code or plain text&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Textwrangler&#60;/strong&#62; I'll use this instead of Eclipse or Textmate if I need to open very large files&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Dropbox&#60;/strong&#62; No need to say much here...&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Screenflow&#60;/strong&#62; I like this for video capture and editing (QuickTime works well for capture but lacks some of the editing features&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Omnifocus&#60;/strong&#62; I try to use this properly but usually end up piling up a bunch of stuff in there and then not really going back to the list as I should&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Expandrive&#60;/strong&#62; I like the Finder integration of this for SFTP&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Keynote&#60;/strong&#62; I still prefer this for presentations&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;OpenOffice&#60;/strong&#62; I do my best to use this, but I still find that going back and forth from MS Word isn't always as smooth as it should be (especially for lists)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Ripit&#60;/strong&#62; To, um, make a backup of DVDs for cultural prosperity&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Voil√†&#60;/strong&#62; Powerful screen-capture and editing (yes, you can do most of it with free software, but...&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;etc. (Skype, VLC, Echofon, Handbrake, Audacity...)
&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I go back and forth with the opensource and free software: I don't mind paying for applications, though I do tend to prefer the customizability of open software. I'm also making more and more effort to have most things in the cloud to ensure that I'm not too locked into any one system.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What do you use?
