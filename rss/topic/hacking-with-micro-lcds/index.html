			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hey, Stéfan -- I've never tried anything with liquid crystal displays, but I always really appreciate Lady Ada's Arduino tutorials (she of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.adafruit.com/&#34;&#62;AdaFruit&#60;/a&#62;).  There are &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ladyada.net/learn/lcd/index.html&#34;&#62;three related to hacking around with LCDs&#60;/a&#62;, including one on the kind that support graphics as well as text.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In general, I think Make's little &#34;&#60;a href=&#34;http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155520&#34;&#62;Getting Started with Arduino&#60;/a&#62;&#34; is worth reading if you're &#60;em&#62;really&#60;/em&#62; just getting started, from which Tom Igoe's &#60;a href=&#34;http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510510&#34;&#62;Making Things Talk&#60;/a&#62;&#34; is then a &#60;em&#62;serious&#60;/em&#62; step up  (I don't have my copy to hand, so can't check to see if there are any LCD projects in there, but it's a book worth mentioning.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd also try searching &#60;a href=&#34;http://instructables.com&#34;&#62;Instructables&#60;/a&#62; for &#34;Arduino LCD&#34; -- I often poke around there for ideas.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you make something, I hope you'll post here and share it!  I'm still looking for input on &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/any-ideas-for-meaningful-dh-oriented-wearable-or-physical-computing&#34;&#62;this DHanswers thread&#60;/a&#62; of mine...

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Stéfan Sinclair's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/hacking-with-micro-lcds#post-790&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It probably was an Arduino -- they're quite common in projects of that nature, assuming it was a simple LCD (like straight text or the like) and not, say, a computer monitor. There are lots of references to Arduinos driving LCDs on the web ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/LCD)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/LCD)&#60;/a&#62; but I don't know how many of them are geared to the beginning Arduino hacker.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I saw a very cool art piece that had a micro LCD display (about an inch wide) that I presume was being driven by an &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino&#34;&#62;Arduino&#60;/a&#62; or something similar. I did some looking around, but was unable to find a good starting point for a fun little project (i.e. hacking with LCDs for dummies that might include code and suggestions of hardware). Anyone out there have any advice or useful links?
