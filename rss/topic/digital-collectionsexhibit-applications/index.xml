			<description>&#60;p&#62;I would look at a powerful CMS like eZpublish or Drupal. I believe eZpublish's LDAP integration is more complete and stable than Drupal's. Otherwise, both should be able to handle the job.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The sysadmin burden is formidable, but I'd give &#60;a href=&#34;http://islandora.ca/&#34;&#62;Islandora&#60;/a&#62; a look.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Every few years we try to find an application that will allow our faculty to build digital collections and that meets the following criteria:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;a) can accommodate multiple collection groups, with each group controlling roles and access (ex: three different departments build their own collections with no overlap between them)&#60;br /&#62;
b) can offer a variety of access options (ex: collections visible to the public, material restricted to groups with a password, visible to groups authenticating via ldap/shibboleth)&#60;br /&#62;
c) can build both collections (search/find/display individual items) and exhibits (items are displayed in the context of a narrative)&#60;br /&#62;
d) can accommodate images, video, audio, pdf, etc. but can also display raw xml/html (ex: TEI-encoded) files&#60;br /&#62;
e) can accommodate multiple designs, each generated by groups' designer instead of by a central sysadmin/designer&#60;br /&#62;
f) is free or really cheap&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We are currently using Omeka and dSpace but neither does all of the above. Some of our faculty use their university-provided web space, sites like Flickr, or even their course space our LMS (Blackboard). Does anyone have alternative (or additional) suggestions, positive or negative?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
