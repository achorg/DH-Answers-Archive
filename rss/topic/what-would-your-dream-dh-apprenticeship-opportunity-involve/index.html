			<description>&#60;p&#62;My dream apprenticeship would involve little or no web development.  Programming is useful in the digital humanities, but it is important to keep in mind that code isn't restricted to publishing on the web.  I know computer scientists who have made extraordinary contributions to the humanities without writing a single line of HTML or CSS.  If the Scholars' Lab seeks to bring computer science students into the fold, they need to be attracted by challenging problems (i.e., not web design).  This could include optical recognition of 3D geometry, quantitative analysis of massive volumes of humanities or social sciences data (not just text, but that could be a start), or augmented reality.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Looking back on my own career development, I wish I had learned information architecture a lot sooner: semantically correct ways of representing information and learning how information systems interact with one another.  And linked data.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This sounds like a wonderful program.  I'd like to draw on a wonderful experience as a graduate student involved in a digital project (redschoolhouse.org, with the UVA Writing Program and with some contact with the Scholar's Lab) in responding to the question.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I think, and I imagine you'd agree, that a &#34;bad&#34; version of such an internship would be to stick a grad student in a room to do some XML or whatever kind of markup for a whole summer, with no &#34;big picture&#34; benefits from participating in the program.  I think what I gained in &#34;big picture&#34; terms from working on a project for a year was: 1) learning how programmers think and 2) learning how project managers think.  Learning how project managers work is fairly easy to do, since one just needs to sit in on a lot of meetings to get the idea—but the benefit is that organizing a project from scratch at another institution would be much easier to do.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thinking like a programmer has a steeper learning curve for most humanities grad students.  I know a lot of DHers who generally &#34;hack&#34;—figuring out through trial and error some rudiments of CSS or PHP—and that's fine for limited and local problems, but it in no way amounts to expertise.  But it seems like graduate students would be in a good position to learn some basic principles of programming (where to write subroutines, stacks, loops, etc.) and best practices, like documenting code and version control.  These skills, while, granted, still well below the BS level in computer science, would aid these graduate students in doing better-informed &#34;hacking&#34; and explaining computer concepts to others, as well as in the future when they'll be working with full-on programmers to put their own projects into motion.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd be excited to see an internship that involved some workshops or independent learning about programming, such that new knowledge might be put to use while participating hands-on in ongoing projects.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Bethany Nowviskie's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-would-your-dream-dh-apprenticeship-opportunity-involve#post-1204&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would be interested in an apprenticeship that allow me to walk away with some tangible new skill and a completed project. For grads, it is important that we walk away from these apprenticeships with something beyond the CV line. I would love to gain experience coding and designing with people who do it for a living. With my own project in mind, my DH apprenticeship would enable me to create a very polished Omeka site for my primary sources and skills in HTML and Php to build my own digital dissertation.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The &#60;a href=&#34;http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab&#34;&#62;Scholars' Lab&#60;/a&#62; is about to get even  more intentional about the contribution it's making to the grad community and to graduate methodological training in DH at UVa.  As we bring on a bunch of new grad student journeymen (and women!) &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.scholarslab.org/announcements/student-jobs/&#34;&#62;all at once&#60;/a&#62;, we're wondering: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What would the specific elements of &#60;strong&#62;your&#60;/strong&#62; dream DH apprenticeship include?  What skills and experiences would you want gain?  What do you need most desperately?  What would you &#60;em&#62;not&#60;/em&#62; find useful or interesting?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We'd love to hear from current grad students (either those gaining real-world DH skills somewhere or wishing they could) and from people past the apprenticeship phase who can share their top experiences and memories of learning on-the-job.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;MANY thanks for your help! This could become a pretty useful DH Answers thread for lots of projects and institutions...
