			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thank you to both of you for your helpful answers!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Melissa, what a great little &#34;crash course&#34; you've laid out for me! You've pretty much hit all the major categories that I need to wrap my head around in order to get started planning my project design.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Mark, this is an angle that I haven't really thought much about. GIS seems to be a pretty hot topic nowadays. I remember it figured prominently at DHSI 2010. It's outside my specific study area, but the part about non-linear stretching of historical map images is definitely something I want to read up on.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Rebecca Niles's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/cutting-edgeessential-image-based-humanities-computing-scholarshipprojects#post-472&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Just a few pointers - you would have to find references yourself :)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Georectification of images, specifically historical maps, is not a bad example.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Identify features on historical maps (perhaps with the assistance of linked historical texts) and tie their estimated location on the historical map to a known location on modern map.  Then perform non-linear streatch (rubber sheeting) to warp historical map so it can be overlaid on modern map.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Probability/reliability measures for points of interest can be visualised, along with links to supporting evidence.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Other systems would be - zoomable tiled image browsers (ie. image pyramid) zoomify etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Enormous volumes of work has been done on making digital surrogates of original documents available with a variety of markup standards for annotation - SVG, TEI etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Image processing techniques, scanning of variety of types (inlcluding infra red, backscatter etc) are used in analysis / preservation / restoration of artworks.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A lot of work has been done on digitising and breaking up / distributing a corpus of work for transcription, double typing verification etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Cheers,&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Rebecca,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;Image based humanities computing&#34; can be broken into a few very different areas.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Firstly, there is the basics of how to create digital images of cultural and heritage artefacts via digitisation, which overlaps with a lot of work digital libraries are doing: see&#60;br /&#62;
Lee, S. (2001). “Digital Imaging, a practical handbook”. Library Association Publishing&#60;br /&#62;
Kenney, A. and Reiger, O. (2000) &#34;Moving Theory Into Practice, Digital Imaging for Libraries and Archives&#34;. RLG.&#60;br /&#62;
for the mechanics and the management of digitisation (these texts also point to good practice and recent projects). For something that explains some more advanced techniques to get the best images possible, try&#60;br /&#62;
Macdonald, L.W. (2006). “Digital Heritage: applying digital imaging to cultural heritage”. Elsevier&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Secondly, there is the stuff about architecture - how to display images once you have them, and allow the sharing and manipulation of image based material. Again, the lit on this is mostly from the digital library point of things (there is a lot of work on, say, the use of tagging, and integrating users own notes into a networked resource). There's very little that I know of on the actual usability of these image systems for the Digital Humanities - an area ripe for study - and you should look at various ways of delivery such as CBIR as well. Without tooting my own trumpet, I would have a flick through  &#34;Terras, M. (2008). “Digital Images for the Information Professional”. Ashgate.&#34; which gives an overview of how images have and are being used in the cultural and heritage sector, and points to a lot of projects that you can look at for best practice. There are loads of cool things happening - not least with crowdsourcing at the moment (which my book doesnt cover). Today Simon Tanner told everyone about the dead sea scrolls and google archive &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.thejc.com/news/israel-news/39956/dead-sea-scrolls-go-google-archive&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.thejc.com/news/israel-news/39956/dead-sea-scrolls-go-google-archive&#60;/a&#62;, we've been working on transcribe bentham &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.transcribe-bentham.da.ulcc.ac.uk/td/Transcribe_Bentham&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.transcribe-bentham.da.ulcc.ac.uk/td/Transcribe_Bentham&#60;/a&#62; and there's lot of stuff with manuscript material happening, too. &#60;a href=&#34;http://melissaterras.blogspot.com/2010/03/crowdsourcing-manuscript-material.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://melissaterras.blogspot.com/2010/03/crowdsourcing-manuscript-material.html&#60;/a&#62;. There's not much written about this from a usability point of view for DH though - people are very much in the construction stages of these image based systems, or using them in institutional contexts.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It is worth looking at image management systems for libraries and archives as well, as they tend to deal with the areas you describe. See Perian Sully's &#34;Collection Management Systems&#34; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a917623888&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a917623888&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
or something like &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.archimuse.com/mw2010/papers/eklund/eklund.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.archimuse.com/mw2010/papers/eklund/eklund.html&#60;/a&#62; from museums and the web.  Not entirely &#34;Digital Humanities&#34; - but a lot of this stuff is going to cross over with digitisation done in cultural and heritage organisations.  There is a lot parked up there on google scholar about this - have a grub around searching for &#34;image management systems heritage&#34; but keep the date to within the last few years. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Finally - we get into the realms of computer science and engineering, and we can talk about image processing - using computational methods to try and analyse images further, to get more information out of them than the human eye can see.  There are various cool projects on this: the archimedes palimpsest &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/imaging_initialtrials1.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/imaging_initialtrials1.html&#60;/a&#62; is the biggy, the dead sea scrolls is another.  We are currently working on &#34;e-science and ancient documents&#34; &#60;a href=&#34;http://esad.classics.ox.ac.uk/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://esad.classics.ox.ac.uk/&#60;/a&#62;  between oxford and ucl, looking at how advanced image processing tools can be used to help read ancient documents. There are various reports on the website and also (sorry for pushing myself again) an overview of the early stages of the project in Terras, M. (2006).&#34;Image to Interpretation: Intelligent Systems to Aid Historians in the Reading of the Vindolanda Texts&#34;. Oxford Studies in Ancient Documents. Oxford University Press.  It has to be said that this cross over between EngSci and DigHum isnt entirely mainstream - but its a lot of fun, and there is a lot of potential for Digital Humanities in working with compsci and engsci in this way. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hope this helps,&#60;br /&#62;
Melissa

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi DH Q&#38;amp;A community,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm a grad student at the iSchool at the University of Toronto and I'm beginning work on a thesis proposal relating to image-based humanities computing. More specifically, I am interested in digital resources that allow textual scholars to explore and manipulate digitized textual artefacts, model/visualize their findings, and/or network their results with others. In your opinions, what papers, books and projects would be must-haves for a lit review in this area? I am particularly interested in suggestions of recent work; I've got a lot of material from pre-2005 (such as McGann's books and essays, the special image-based humanities computing edition of Computers and the Humanities (36.1) and Kevin Kiernan's work on electronic Beowulf and related papers), but not as much from the past 5 years. Any suggestions for further reading would be greatly appreciated!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks very much!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Rebecca Niles&#60;br /&#62;
