			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I wrote a blog post on getting data into Gephi here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2013/09/09/dataintogephi&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/2013/09/09/dataintogephi&#60;/a&#62;. The short version is that you need to create some kind of dataset like a spreadsheet that shows relationships among whatever you want to analyze (e.g. characters in the texts). My main focus isn't information visualization, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that Gephi or its plugins are set up to import a whole text and work with it that way (i.e. I don't think there's something that lets you import a text and then highlight and pull out the characters or other things you want to visualize).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You might be interested in some other blog posts I wrote while learning Gephi and doing some basic projects, for tutorials and a sense of what Gephi can do: &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/gephi/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/tag/gephi/&#60;/a&#62;. I've used Gephi to look at the types of interactions between characters in James Joyce's novel Ulysses (what characters talk to each other, and what is the depth of those interactions?), and to explore who's citing what sources in the Digital Humanities Quarterly scholarly journal.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This recent post on cool infoviz tools and projects in the digital humanities might have some inspiration, and it also links to people with far more infoviz experience than me who probably have helpful blog posts and tutorials or slides you could search for: &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2015/09/25/infovizlinks/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/2015/09/25/infovizlinks/&#60;/a&#62; &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;E.g. Miriam Posner has a post on getting started with humanities data viz: &#60;a href=&#34;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/#&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/#&#60;/a&#62;&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/tags/network'&#62;network&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;E.g. Scott Weingart on when not to use data viz: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?p=39600&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?p=39600&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It was also just announced that a Gephi update is coming in December with some improvements: &#60;a href=&#34;https://gephi.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/announcing-gephi-0-9-release-date/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://gephi.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/announcing-gephi-0-9-release-date/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know that a big holdup for me with Gephi was figuring out that the latest version didn't work with my Mac (I had to use the second-to-latest version instead).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi!&#60;br /&#62;
I'm a student from Brazil, and I'm looking for help to text network analysis using Gephi graph visualization software. I have a lot of texts in portuguese to anylise, and Gephi's tools seem to be the best to reach the result I want. So how do I import text to Gephi?&#60;br /&#62;
Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
