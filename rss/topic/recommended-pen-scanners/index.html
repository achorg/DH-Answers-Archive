			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Kirstyn, shortly after this exchange I purchased a device online that looked like a pen but ended up actually being something that you lay on its side to slide along the page and scan – not really what I was after. Feeling a bit sheepish about not looking closer before purchasing and more generally discouraged by this search, I simply gave up. Years ago I remember Willard McCarty showing me a pen scanner that he was using, I'll ask him about this and report back if anything currently available emerges.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Stephan - I am joining this conversation about a year late, but what did you end up doing? I was just researching pen scanners when I found your query, and was reminded by Rachel's response that I also *just* bought an iPhone and I might be able to scan with that. But a pen does sound efficient ... and I'm an over-flagger of library books -- it's devastating to have to return them and lose all of my flagged notes when I do so. And it takes way too long to type in all the sentences I want to preserve in each work. #conundrum
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;That's a good question. I guess I tend to grab sentences here and there instead of full pages (or parts of pages). Taking a picture and then cropping out what I need and/or selecting the text to OCR would just add additional steps, which would decrease the chances that I'd actually do them (sort of like how I mark up margins (with pencil) now but very rarely go back and transcribe the text). I may be mistaken, but a pen scanner would seem the most efficient for how I read, I think.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Curious -- why go for a single-use device like a pen scanner rather than using a smartphone camera? There are apps that will do OCR and whatnot.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It feels a bit dirty to ask such a product-oriented question here, but does anyone have recommendations for pen scanners like &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.planon.com/products/docupen/xseries&#34;&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;? I'd rather have something that has onboard storage and power so that I don't need to be tethered to a USB cable (or other modes of immediate transfer); I want to scan from book in comfy reading chair now, transfer later.
