			<description>&#60;p&#62;Depending on your ambitions for a project like this, many digital humanities centers would need some outside support in order to assist with a effort by someone outside their home institutions.  &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/im-considering-a-move-to-the-chicago-area-whats-the-dh-scene-like-there&#34;&#62;Start-up funding&#60;/a&#62; from an NEH grant, for instance, would help.  And regional &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62; events are often excellent places to meet up with faculty and staff from DH centers, publishers, humanities agencies, and cultural heritage institutions and find out about opportunities to collaborate.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You may also want to register on the new &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org/&#34;&#62;DH Commons site&#60;/a&#62;, which is designed for people seeking collaborators or offering collaborative opportunities.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you are looking for publishing platforms or journals that support multi-media work, you should consider &#60;a href=&#34;http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/&#34;&#62;MediaCommons&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://vectors.usc.edu/journal/index.php?page=Introduction&#34;&#62;Vectors&#60;/a&#62;.  The Vectors team is also working on a new digital publishing tool, &#60;a href=&#34;http://scalar.usc.edu/anvc/?page_id=6&#34;&#62;Scalar&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, I am a Fulbright Scholar working on translation practice and theory. I'd like to solicit ideas for organizations that would support a multi-media presentation of the translations I am writing. Ideally, I would work with an organization that it invested in innovation in digital publishing, and the humanities.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Just throwing this out there for ideas--thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
