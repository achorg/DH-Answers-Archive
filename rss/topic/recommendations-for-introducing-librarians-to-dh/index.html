			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've struggled a bit with this, too, since the field is so broad. Sometimes I'd think I'd done a great job explaining, only to have librarians tell me later that my explanation was confusing. I've learned to try to tailor my explanation to the group I'm talking to, and to spend a lot of time on a few projects rather than slaloming through a bunch. So if I'm in a presentation setting, I'll try to get a sense of what the audience might find interesting. Some of my go-to example projects are those that are easily grasped, visually impressive, and clearly accomplish something that couldn't easily be accomplished as a monograph: &#60;a href=&#34;https://republicofletters.stanford.edu/&#34;&#62;Mapping the Republic of Letters, &#60;/a&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.americanpast.org/voting/&#34;&#62;Voting America&#60;/a&#62;, and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/index.faces&#34;&#62;Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database&#60;/a&#62;, for example. You don't need a technical background to see what these projects do and why they're cool. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My favorite online directories include the &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/The_CUNY_Digital_Humanities_Resource_Guide&#34;&#62;CUNY Digital Humanities Guide&#60;/a&#62;, Lisa Spiro's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/getting-started-in-the-digital-humanities/&#34;&#62;&#34;Getting Started in the Digital Humanities,&#34;&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://arts-humanities.net/&#34;&#62;arts-humanities.net&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are many examples of library-based DH, too: &#60;a href=&#34;http://scholar.library.miami.edu/archivoteatral/&#34;&#62;The Cuban Theater Digital Archive&#60;/a&#62;, the &#60;a href=&#34;http://livingstone.library.ucla.edu/&#34;&#62;Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project&#60;/a&#62;, and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://docsouth.unc.edu/blueridgeparkway/&#34;&#62;Digital Blue Ridge Parkway&#60;/a&#62;, to name a few. Projects like these might provide some inspiration if your library is looking for ways to support DH.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In addition to what Brian said, I always point people to Lisa Spiro's amazing round-up blog post on Getting Started in the Digital Humanities.  You can find it here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/getting-started-in-the-digital-humanities/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/getting-started-in-the-digital-humanities/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, the folks here at Emory's Digital Scholarship Commons would be more than happy to chat/skype/hangout with anyone who wants to talk about supporting DH as librarians.  you can email me directly at &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:stewart.varner@emory.edu&#34;&#62;stewart.varner@emory.edu&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;As a first thought, I would suggest looking at the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arl.org/resources/pubs/spec/complete.shtml&#34;&#62;ARL Spec Kit #326&#60;/a&#62;, which examines Digital Humanities in the Library. I'd also consider a number of &#60;em&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports&#34;&#62;CLIR Reports&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/em&#62;, including #143, A Survey of DH Centers in the US.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What resources would you recommend for introducing librarians to what DH is and what it can do? Examples of DH/library projects would be great, as well as sites that explain field and link out to more resources? (other than ACH, of course!) thanks
