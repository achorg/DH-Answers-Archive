			<description>&#60;p&#62;With such a large storage need, you will likely find (as many others have pointed out) that it's not cost effective to couple your storage with your hosting (since hosts, just like cellphone manufacturers, always WAY overcharge for storage space). So one possible alternative would be to split up the hosting and the storage. You can get up to 1TB of Amazon S3 storage for a penny a GB, meaning you'd only be paying 57 cents a month with your needs ... then integrate that with the $5/month plan at Digital Ocean (where you don't end up paying for all the features you'll never use on a shared host ... they just spin up a virtual server for you to do with as you please), pay $12 / year for the domain name through a registrar-only service, and you've hit your price point.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've used &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.justhost.com/hosting-features&#34;&#62;JustHost&#60;/a&#62; for several years and have been happy with their service and customer service. There is a limit on the number of files you can store, so you wouldn't want to keep a large archive of images there. (Check other services for similar restrictions.) That's OK if you've got another place to store the files and if you can handle any &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing&#34;&#62;CORS&#60;/a&#62; issues that may arise from having them on a separate domain.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm using Reclaim Hosting for a lot of faculty projects, but I've also used Bluehost for years. Technically, at least, they have unlimited storage, subdomains, databases, etc., but I've had really big Drupal sites (with 100k+ pieces of content) go over their limit of 2GB/database. You can also only run maybe 5-6 Drupal sites before you go over their max allowed # of database tables per account.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I find Reclaim Hosting quite good and they're Omeka's top suggestion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Shared hosting is really cheap, but there is a 10gb limit. For your 57gb + of images the only clear option they offer is $40 per month. Worth keeping in mind for comparison purposes if nothing else: &#60;a href=&#34;https://reclaimhosting.com/pricing/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://reclaimhosting.com/pricing/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've always used University resources for web hosting (web site, Wordpress blog, Omeka, dSpace, etc.) but now I have some personal research to post so I would like to start building my own space outside the University. So, here is the usual,frequently asked, difficultly broad question: can anyone recommend a web hosting service? I see BlueHost, DreamHost and HostGator talked about but would like pros and cons of those and others. Any new hosts making a splash? Any you have dealt with in the past that were disappointing?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My requirements are decent service, cheap (under $10/month if possible), domain name, lots of space (currently have about 3,000 images using 57 GB of space. About half of that is in tifs that I can store elsewhere but this will continue to be a growing image database), and I'll want to install the programs listed above along with whatever may come along. I've installed and run MAMP locally but, as I said, this will be the first time doing this out in the big world so I'm not even sure which questions to ask about what to look for.
