			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi mariazoey,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I think you may have a few questions packed in here! First, you're absolutely right that finding a job as a faculty member in an English department is really tough. Unfortunately, the academic job market is pretty bad all around, not just in English. And it's a big investment of your time. As you might know, a Ph.D. is pretty much required to teach at a university. Getting one usually takes about six or seven years after your B.A.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some people will &#60;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/article/Graduate-School-in-the/44846/&#34;&#62;tell you&#60;/a&#62; that job prospects for faculty are so bad that it's not worth your time to get a Ph.D. in the humanities, period. Others &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dispositio.net/archives/586&#34;&#62;will say&#60;/a&#62; that you should go if it's really what you love more than anything else, but you should be aware that there may not be a job waiting for you at the other end.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The other question I see in your post is about &#34;new media&#34; versus &#34;digital humanities.&#34; Confusingly enough, these are actually two separate fields. To make some really broad generalizations: People who study new media write and think about the effect of new media on people's lives. In digital humanities, the emphasis tends to be on making things â€” designing software, analyzing data, creating online archives, things like that. &#60;a href=&#34;http://projectroomseattle.org/2012/03/making-things/&#34;&#62;Here's&#60;/a&#62; a good article that does a nice job summarizing the &#34;making&#34; part of digital humanities.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So I guess I have more questions for you than answers: Is teaching at a university what you really, really want to do? How important is secure employment to you? Do you want to be a university professor because you love studying and writing, or because you're seeking a secure career? If it's the latter, there may be better routes for you.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is not meant to dissuade you from studying new media or digital humanities! I think these are both wonderful things to study, and the University of Kansas even has a &#60;a href=&#34;http://cds.lib.ku.edu/tag/digital-humanities/&#34;&#62;digital humanities center&#60;/a&#62; that you could take advantage of. But it does sound as though sitting down with a career counselor, either at your current institution or at the one where you end up, might be a good idea.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Very best of luck to you!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have been completing hours for an AA to transfer for an English undergrad degree. Recently it has come to my attention that teaching university English is a field mostly closed to new blood, due to the number of highly-qualified individuals already there. I'm considering switching to a career path in teaching Digital Humanities or New Media instead, but feel a little lost as to knowing what would be a fruitful undergrad degree versus one that's actually worthless in the face of a teaching career. What degrees are useful? Which schools are good? Are there any in the Kansas City area?? Thanks a bunch.
