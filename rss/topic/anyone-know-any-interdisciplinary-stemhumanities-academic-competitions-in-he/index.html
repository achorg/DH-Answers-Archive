			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am a mature, Natural Sciences undergraduate student, studying at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, England.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am writing an article entitled:&#60;br /&#62;
Academic Competitions in Higher Education â€“ Opening a gateway for student initiative, creativity and interdisciplinarity.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;More specifically:&#60;br /&#62;
How academic competitions in HE (International, National or Localised) can allow UNDERGRADUATE students to:&#60;br /&#62;
 - Operate academic skills in a more creative and initiative-based way.&#60;br /&#62;
 - Facilitate the real application of learned material.&#60;br /&#62;
 - Facilitate the application of knowledge to real-world challenges outside of academia. (e.g Engineering competitions, such as the ones listed below).&#60;br /&#62;
 - Facilitate cooperation between academic disciplines.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For the article I am trying to find as many varied examples as I can, ranging from purely STEM based competitions,( &#60;a href=&#34;http://innovation.wisc.edu/sustainability/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://innovation.wisc.edu/sustainability/&#60;/a&#62; )&#60;br /&#62;
Interdisciplinary examples ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://igem.org/About&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://igem.org/About&#60;/a&#62; ) and Humanities examples ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://openhumanitiesawards.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://openhumanitiesawards.org/&#60;/a&#62; ).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am also interested in any other forms of extra curricular activities which facilitate undergraduate student initiative, creativity and interdisciplinarity. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any help, or a point in the direction of someone who might be able to, would be much appreciated. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;All the best&#60;br /&#62;
