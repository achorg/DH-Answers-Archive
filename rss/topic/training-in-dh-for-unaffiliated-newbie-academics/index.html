			<description>&#60;p&#62;I agree with Patrick that the best (and most well-trodden!) path to engagement in DH is to invest some real time in DIY tinkering and good old fashioned puttering around, particularly if you can focus your experimentation on a project or investigation you find inherently motivating.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In terms of newbie-friendly programs and conferences, &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org&#34;&#62;THATCamps&#60;/a&#62; are terrific, low-cost and friendly introductions to DH.  They're tremendous regional networking opportunities as well -- but you'll also find a welcoming community at the annual &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org&#34;&#62;DH conference&#60;/a&#62; (where the &#60;a href=&#34;http://ach.org&#34;&#62;ACH&#60;/a&#62; hosts a longstanding &#60;a href=&#34;http://ach.org/mentoring&#34;&#62;mentoring program&#60;/a&#62;, which now runs year-round) and at conferences like SDH-SEMI (see, for example, &#60;a href=&#34;http://sdh-semi.org/2012/04/01/introductory-workshopts-on-digital-humanities-at-congress-2012-in-waterloo/&#34;&#62;these workshops&#60;/a&#62;, held just last week).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Most of the North American training institutes with which I'm familiar (like &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhsi.org&#34;&#62;DHSI&#60;/a&#62; and the new &#60;a href=&#34;http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/&#34;&#62;DHWI&#60;/a&#62;) are open to independent scholars and work hard to cover costs or keep them reasonably low. The various NEH-supported &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/institutes&#34;&#62;IATDH programs&#60;/a&#62; are generally a bit more advanced (that's what the &#34;A&#34; stands for), but also open to people without institutional affiliation and costs are usually covered.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;More and more training programs are being attached to disciplinary conferences. I'm not sure what's in the works for AHA, but the &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org/&#34;&#62;DH Commons&#60;/a&#62; group will host another &#34;Getting Started in DH&#34; workshop at the MLA conference this January. (And you should definitely register with and explore DH Commons in general!)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Staying plugged in with Twitter is now a must. &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/&#34;&#62;DH Now&#60;/a&#62; can help you follow the conversations being had in the community, and discover new resources. It's being drawn from &#60;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&#38;amp;hl=en_US&#38;amp;key=0AucqXAIBhf_idGNlZzVjSGkxQU9XNU4yb0w1clMxeXc&#38;amp;single=true&#38;amp;gid=3&#38;amp;output=html&#34;&#62;these people&#60;/a&#62; and their feeds -- also worth some exploration.  And I'm sure you've already discovered past threads on DH Answers that speak to basic readings, tools and platforms, etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Welcome and best of luck!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I kinda have to giggle, just at how quickly perceptions and activity around DH are changing. The giggly case in point, your question about how open the field is to humanists who are not digital. DH is chock-full of people who came to it from not being digital, so we're all about new humanists becoming more digitally/technologically savvy!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some of the institutes and workshops do assume a certain level of knowledge, but often they are just as appropriate for newcomers. If it isn't clear in the descriptions, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is probably coming from how I got into DH, but good places to start are just using some of the open source tools for a real project, or research, or some other activity. Easy possible gateways are starting a wordpress blog for your research on wordpress.com, then if you want more control of the site to install your own wordpress installation on a shared hosting service like bluehost.com or dreamhost.com. Or, similarly, producing an omeka site on omeka.net and put together a research project there, and/or install your own omeka on a shared hosting service to do so. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Installing your own on a shared hosting service is a pretty good way to make first steps into becoming &#34;digital&#34;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If there's one coming up in your area, I'd also suggest attending a &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62;. I know a couple people in situations similar to what you describe from THATCamps.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is clearly from the &#34;Do-It-Yourself/Build-It-Yourself&#34; perspective on DH, so I imagine you will get responses with lots of other great ideas from other perspectives. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Good luck!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello All,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I’m a historian who, after some years of teaching, has veered off the T-T seeking track but remains committed to research. The&#60;br /&#62;
plethora of innovative current DH projects has caused me to investigate entering the field, but I seem to have hit a snag. I'm strictly a historian, with no computing background. I've noticed that DH is a hot new training field for grad students, recent PhDs, or those with institutional affiliation, but what if, like me, you are further down the academic track, wanting to become trained or involved in these initiatives, *but* no longer affiliated with an institution?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Are there any specific paths or opportunities you would recommend to become involved in the field (say, in existing projects)? On a related note, how open is the field to humanists who are not, well, digital? While I've noted summer institutes or workshops, those seem geared to people already steeped in DH. In short, I’d value hearing your thoughts on gaining practical experience from a relatively outlier perspective. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
