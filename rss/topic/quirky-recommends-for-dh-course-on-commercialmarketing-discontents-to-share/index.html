			<description>&#60;p&#62;Okay, it sounds like you are teaching a course that is part of a DH curriculum, and this course is on the commercial and business aspects of DH practice.  While you've already accumulated a list of texts, you are interested in finding non-text course material as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;No text or non-text material come to mind right now, but I'll keep your query in mind.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear Kevin, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd be delighted to provide more information. I'm putting together a new DH module that will focus on the commercial aspects - advertising, brands, promotion and other 'marketing' activities. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There is scope here for new course material development away from texts including youtube, full length movies, exhibitions, everyday 'in the wild' advertisements, campaigns etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The module is UG optional 2nd year, and also for MA students as a Core module.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As there is a business element to the course and context, at present I am building up a portfolio of content that is based on DH theories and discussions and will provide added 'real world' dimensions to the discussions. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Please, Kevin do say if you would like further information.  I've had some lovely emails from DH users in terms of their thoughts and materials that might be relevant - and once I've a compendium of useful 'items' I'd be only too happy to share these - if this is appropriate. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Very best &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Mariann

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello thatdrmaz (mh),&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't understand from the subject line of the posting or from your first paragraph what exactly the scope of the course is, and I only have a slightly better idea looking at your reading list so far.  Do you have a few paragraphs from the course syllabus or something to share?  I think that will help us all better out figure what to recommend.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;—Kevin

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello all, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am putting together a new course based on DH and tied specifically to the effect and context on advertising, commercial activities and that dirty dirty phrase 'marketing'.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've a 'wealth' of textual reading material - some good, some just ok, others more interesting [please do see below], but what I'd really like to put together and share [after I've collated it all] are other interesting resources e.g. film/movie recommendations, youtube links, images, soundscapes, exhibitions, adverts, quirky and unusual things... etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you have anything that you have come across that you'd like to share, this would be tremendous.  In that spirit of sharing, I've put below some of the texts that I'll be using...And it's likely that you'll have some better texts to share also! &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Lovely, and thanks!  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;mh. &#60;/p&#62;
