			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is a very good question, but one that gets tricky very fast. For instance, a seemingly simple phrase like &#34;a job within the field&#34; (of digital humanities) is difficult to define.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Employers &#34;out there&#34; aren't (yet) looking for digital humanists since that's a label that's only starting to gain momentum in academia. On the other hand, there's any number employers looking for humanists of various stripes, and the technical skills that you already have may very well seem like a strong additional asset (something to differentiate you from most of the other applicants).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Within academia there have been several job ads recently for people with digital humanities competencies, though often the technical expectations are relatively high. You can get a sense of the diversity of jobs in the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.hastac.org/forum/23&#34;&#62;HASTAC Fellowship and Employment Opportunities&#60;/a&#62; forum.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for options for grad school, a good starting point is &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/is-there-a-list-anywhere-of-all-the-graduate-programs-that-study-dh&#34;&#62;this thread&#60;/a&#62; on DHAnswers.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As with most jobs and careers, it's very useful to start networking early and often. If you can make it to a &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org/&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62; or DH Conference like &#60;a href=&#34;https://dh2011.stanford.edu/&#34;&#62;DH2011&#60;/a&#62;, you'll get a better sense of what opportunities may be available and you'll meet some very interesting folks. Good luck!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am a Senior at the University of Mary Washington and have taken a couple of courses that look more into the field of Digital Humanities. Two of them being Digital History and Digital Storytelling. Unfortunately I am coming to that time where I have to start thinking about my future. I was wondering what kind of options are out there for those interested in the field of Digital Humanities. Would I need to go to graduate school to have a chance at finding a job within the field? Or do I have the basic skills I already need/ Are there internships or other programs that also support the field of Digital Humanities? I am actually more so interested in History because that is where I will get my bachelors. However I am open to any kind of advice. Thank you!
