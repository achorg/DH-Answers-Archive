			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sorry for the delay, this one slipped through the Holiday cracks for some reason. I created the zotero group. Everyone is welcome to chime in and expand the bibliography: &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/groups/open_source_resources&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.zotero.org/groups/open_source_resources&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Several months ago, there was an attempt to make a &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/groups/open_source_practices/items&#34;&#62;zotero group&#60;/a&#62; to gather materials relating to your questions. I just checked now, and there haven't been any entries beyond the original few. Perhaps if we get enough people reading this question to add entries, we can keep a running bibliography of sources. I'm going to create a zotero group that we can all edit and share. Check back later this evening.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It doesn't speak directly to research in the humanities, but any list of books about open source needs to have &#60;a href=&#34;http://catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar&#34;&#62;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&#60;/a&#62; (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Accidental-Revolutionary-CATHEDRAL/dp/B002E9RD4Q/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#38;amp;qid=1292860190&#38;amp;sr=8-2&#34;&#62;from Amazon&#60;/a&#62;, too) in it somewhere.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Update: oops, looks like jean beat me to it while I was typing!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This might not be what you're looking for, but I think two of the most important (and better written) reads on Open Source are&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://manybooks.net/titles/raymondericother05cathedralandbazaar.html&#34;&#62;Eric Raymond's &#60;em&#62;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html&#34;&#62;Yochai Benkler's &#34;Coase's Penguin&#34;&#60;/a&#62;.  The first looks at the ethos (and genesis) of open source software design and the later is a discussion of the economics of Open Source.  Both have been around for a while, and while neither addresses the humanities is particular, I think the parallels are more than apparent.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for articles or books on the affect or use or impact of the open source movement in software development on research in the humanities.
