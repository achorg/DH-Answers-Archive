			<description>&#60;p&#62;For graduate new media students, I'd recommend Drupal over Wordpress. Yes, the learning curve is steeper, but the power of Drupal and its wonderful modules ecosystem make it worthwhile, particularly if you're trying to give people skills that will enable them to make sophisticated sites later. The basic concepts are pretty easy and installing the Administrator Menu module makes site navigation when adding content much, much simpler. Then, once they have basic navigation and content adding concepts down, you can highlight the most important modules like CCK and Views.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Of course, I'm partial to Drupal anyway. I just used it to build a course site last week: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelwidner.com/courses&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.michaelwidner.com/courses&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Agreed with Kaia that WordPress is the way to go for quick and easy getting started, provided the needs aren't overly complicated. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It will likely be useful to watch &#60;a href=&#34;http://scholarpress.net&#34;&#62;Scholarpress&#60;/a&#62;, a plugin designed to help build course sites. Probably won't be ready for spring semester, but maybe for the fall.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One plugin that we've used a lot is FeedWordPress to ingest posts into a WP site. We have a lot of faculty at UMW who create a &#34;mother&#34; site of course content, and uses FeedWordPress to bring in content from students' own, individual sites. That makes a nice way to have a unity to the site, while giving students experience administering their own sites and thinking about moving content around the web.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I think Wordpress would probably be a good choice, although that really depends on exactly what features you need. Your students could certainly benefit from learning to use Wordpress, but it's easy enough that they should be able to pick it up quickly anyway.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Drupal is not as easy to pick up. Without an HTML/css/php background, your students may find Drupal tough. It is, however, a very useful tool when you need that level of complexity.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, the short answer is if you won't have time to spend working with them on the tool, use Wordpress.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi all. Over the years, I've constructed my course web sites with a variety of tools: Blackboard and other proprietary systems, hand-coded html/css, and Google Sites. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd like to start using a CMS -- partially because I'm not totally satisfied with any of these prior tools and partially because I'd like to force myself to get a little more acquainted with a useful CMS system that I might teach my students down the road.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have strong feelings about which CMS offers the best combo of features for building course sites and is a technology that would be valuable/feasible for students to learn? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I teach graduate-level new media courses; the students I teach typically go on to work in communication roles in smaller organizations or as consultants to smaller or mid-sized organizations. They may be tasked with post-graduation jobs like designing and implementing web sites and blogs or integrating all of an organization's social and online communications.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Before I learn yet another tool, I'd like to feel like it's one that will continue to be useful for educational and organizational content-management tasks for the foreseeable future. Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
