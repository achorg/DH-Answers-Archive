			<description>&#60;p&#62;Alex's answer provides a good suggestion for getting started. I would also suggest simply looking at the types of questions asked here and also the categories themselves.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;After you've spent some time doing that, it's likely you'll have MANY more questions, specifically about things you've read about.  Take a look at the &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/so-what-is-this-qa-forum-and-what-can-i-do-here&#34;&#62;what is this forum?&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-can-i-find-info-thats-already-been-discussed-help-dhanswers-grow&#34;&#62;how can I find answers to questions?&#60;/a&#62; threads for more information on asking the types of questions that will help us produce the best and most useful answers for you.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The field is enormous, and it is certainly impossible to answer that question in a single post. Reading through the different threads in this Q&#38;amp;A can give you an idea of the range of projects. I also recommend you read &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.hastac.org/blogs/cforster/im-chris-where-am-i-wrong&#34;&#62;this post&#60;/a&#62; by &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/cforster&#34;&#62;@&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/cforster'&#62;cforster&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/a&#62;. The responses to that post also tell you plenty about the kinds of things folk are doing in the DH.
