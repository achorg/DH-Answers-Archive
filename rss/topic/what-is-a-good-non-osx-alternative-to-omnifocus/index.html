&#60;p&#62;Steven Johnson is where I learned about DevonThink.  He's always talking about it.  You are correct that the alternatives list lacks something with that AI, though.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm a long-time DEVONthink user and based on what I know of the program (and it's helper app DEVONagent) there's not a Windows app that matches up feature for feature.  But, there are people thinking about it...here's a list of alternatives.  You'll see that Evernote is the most similar...but as you mention, it lacks the AI feature.   Of course, the AI feature works best when you use only small chunks of text in your typical DEVONthink document.  The longer the doc, the less utility you see in the AI...Stephen Johnson explained it well in a post some years back: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000230.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000230.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Anyway, here's the list:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://alternativeto.net/software/devonthink/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://alternativeto.net/software/devonthink/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I keep hearing about the wonder that is Devonthink, with its ability to collect materials from all over the place, and, more importantly, its AI that lets it make novel connections between things.  I don't have a Mac, so, what are some alternatives for Windows or Linux, or in the cloud?  I use Evernote for some things, and I like it, but it lacks the algorithm that Devonthink boasts. I have heard OneNote suggested as an alternative, but I think it has the same limitation.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;-edit: I originally posted this as a question about Omnifocus, but I meant to say Devonthink.  Must be the cold meds.
