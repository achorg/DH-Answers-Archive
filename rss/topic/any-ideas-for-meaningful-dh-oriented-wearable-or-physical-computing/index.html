			<description>&#60;p&#62;Geoff, thanks for the book recommendation, and these observations about iterative sketching and design thinking!  I should add to this thread that I've been collecting resources for a while in &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/groups/soft_circuitry&#34;&#62;Soft Circuitry&#60;/a&#62;, a collaborative Zotero group.  &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/groups/soft_circuitry/items&#34;&#62;This view&#60;/a&#62; shows that we've broken the collection up under the headings, &#34;Formal Publications,&#34; &#34;Teaching and Learning,&#34; and &#34;Inspiration and Materials.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One thing I love about the LilyPad Arduino community is Leah Buechley's emphasis on soft circuits as a path to teaching young girls to hack things and code.  I guess what I'm looking for (and maybe will have to write) is a similar approach to wearable computing and embodied interaction for serious (eh, semi-serious) DH.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Last year we had a group of students in humanities computing (MA) and in design (MDes) in a reading course on interactives. Most of them did a final project together which involved building on the Monome -&#38;gt; Arduinome. They basically developed a basic platform for experimenting with interactivity built on the whole Arduinome design and then illustrated a number of different things that could be done with this platform. I was sufficiently impressed that I have commissioned two of the boxes (one nice touch - they designed an enclosure for the platform) so that we can begin a series of experiments in public interactivity.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Another student in the reading course created a jacket that could be used as a prop for magic shows. He is a performing magician - his jacket has lights under the fabric that he could trigger by playing with a jacket button. The light sequences were designed to add to his performances. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't know if these ideas are useful, and I would love to have you involved in the interactivity project.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One thing we did find in the course was that:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;a) there was a real difference between how MA students do research and how MDes students do it. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;b) the design students are used to iteratively sketching ideas in a way that got the students unstuck. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, I guess I'm recommending that you talk to some design folk about how they think about design. A book I like that describes some design practices is Brenda Laurel's collection on _Design Research_.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm interested in wearables and physical computing -- in the sense of tactile, embodied interaction like that made possible by the Lilypad Arduino, a sew-able, programmable microprocessor. My problem is that, conceptually, I can't get past toys and art pieces -- like blinky, light-up merit badges, ambient orbs that respond to the state of my inbox, a tipsyflower made of shape-memory wire &#38;amp; breathalyzer parts, jewelry that whines when you walk north... &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd like to design a project that I felt was meaningful in terms of digital humanities theory or research -- something useful within, or reflective about, the field. And I'm just stuck. Any ideas? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;No experience in soft circuits or arduinos necessary: I've just got a weird kind of writer's block and am looking for inspiration.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
