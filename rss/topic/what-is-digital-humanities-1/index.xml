			<description>&#60;p&#62;And this last one is perhaps the most useful for me:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;I would define it as the intersection between computing technologies and research and teaching in the humanities. Influenced by web technologies, it also promotes collaborative approaches to scholarship.&#34; — Alexandra Guerson&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This definition resonates with me in a couple of ways: first, I concur with the idea of &#34;collaborative approaches to scholarship.&#34; Our digital world certainly allows--perhaps, encourages--collaboration. Also, as Terry Heick asserts: &#34;. . .the 21st century’s model is form and interdependence.&#34; Web 2.0, I believe, has positioned us for Heick's assertion and the very collaboration in this definition.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have to &#34;ditto&#34; what I have just said to the idea in the definition of &#34;computing technologies and research.&#34; It is far easier to access information with something as mundane as a search function on my browser as it was keeping hundreds of note cards and multiple legal pads from my dissertation research. This &#34;intersection&#34; has radically changed research across all disciplines.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far--this definition helps me understand the term, but I am puzzled by how this definition informs my teaching and my students' learning.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;From the same source as above this definition: &#34;As a social construct.&#34;— louburnard. . .&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This definition certainly avoids the implicit absolutism of the previous one I noted, but it seems incomplete: a social construct of what? who is the &#34;constructor&#34;? from what is this &#34;construction&#34; built?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A problem with metaphors (and construct here is obviously metaphoric) is that they can lead us into directions we did not intend.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Here is one definition: &#34;Digital Humanities allow people a new possibility to access knowledge and in turn generates new knowledge.&#34; — Michelle Moore&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Do I access knowledge or do I access information that, after some reflection and discussion, becomes knowledge?  Also, is &#34;knowledge&#34; (which in this quote seems to suggest something &#34;absolute&#34;) constant or does it change? For example, we once accepted as &#34;knowledge&#34; that the world as flat (Thomas Friedman notwithstanding), yet today we do not accept this knowledge.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There are already some great resources for this, particularly &#60;a href=&#34;http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/&#34;&#62;http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/&#60;/a&#62;, which consists of over 500 definitions from people who have participated in the annual Day of DH. I've culled together some definitions here as well: &#60;a href=&#34;http://sites.library.northwestern.edu/dh/&#34;&#62;http://sites.library.northwestern.edu/dh/&#60;/a&#62;. I also suspect that &#60;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DefiningDH&#34;&#62;https://twitter.com/DefiningDH&#60;/a&#62; will be of some help; although it's not entirely clear to me yet what this project will be, the folks behind it have been collocating many definitional tweets. Good luck on your project!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello Digital Humanists,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am creating a video from crowdsourced answers to the question &#34;What is Digital Humanities?&#34;. I would appreciate any short response you could provide re same and permission to publish your answer in the video. The aim of this project is to provide a brief introduction to DH for novice digital humanists or those who are not familiar with the field.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Looking forward to hearing your suggestions. Please also provide your Twitter username re acknowledging your contribution.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Many thanks,&#60;/p&#62;
