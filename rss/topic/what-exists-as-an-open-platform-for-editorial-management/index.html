			<description>&#60;p&#62;In fact, when configuring a journal in OJS, there's an option to say that the OJS is used only for submissions and editorial management but not for actually publishing the journal.  This prevents the &#34;current issue&#34; and &#34;archives&#34; links from appearing in the interface, confusing readers.  See &#60;a href=&#34;http://journal.tei-c.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://journal.tei-c.org/&#60;/a&#62; for an example of an OJS instance that is used for managing submissions but not for actually publishing issues.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here is a list of things that at one point or another struck me as covering editorial management.  Many are not open-source, but I'll let you sort through for anything of interest:&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I don't know about the two WordPress solutions -- though I have been really, really impressed with all the things that can be done, and done well, with WordPress in general -- but I'd like to echo the Open Journal software and its cousins (Open Conference et al.). I've been on the reviewing side of the setup, as well as someone who reads a number of open access journals published using the OJS setup, and I have to say it is very close to painless. Easy to use. Nice outputs.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For WordPress, look into the Atahualpa and Montezuma themes, both of which are specialized for publishing workflows. (Read &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.cetis.ac.uk/philb/2012/03/13/cetis-publications-now-on-wordpress/&#34;&#62;an account of publishing with Atahualpa&#60;/a&#62;.) Having tangled with and bounced off Montezuma, I can say that there's a significant learning/customization curve, but whether it's worth climbing for you is yours to answer.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If PressForward ever gets out of vaporware stage, it too is likely to be worth looking at.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you want to move to Drupal, there's an &#60;a href=&#34;http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/5913&#34;&#62;excellent article in Code4lib Journal&#60;/a&#62; you should read.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You could look into using an instance of Open Journal Systems, an open source management system for peer reviewed journals from the Public Knowledge Project. You'd want it essentially just for its backend management systems not for actually publishing the journal since that's happening through Wordpress. The OJS site and documentation can be found here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Of course, then you have two systems to manage and support.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking into platforms that can be used as an editorial management system for a project I'm providing assistance with. I'm working with a faculty member who is publishing reviews of dissertations with WordPress. The challenge he and his co-editor are having is with their system for keeping track of editors, people contacted for review, and the state reviews are in. They have a large editorial team assigned to specific historical fields, who work directly in finding reviewers and soliciting reviewees. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What they're running up against is tracking all these people. They currently are using Google Spreadsheets to track who has been contacted, who needs contacting, if someone's been contacted and declined review, if someone's been contacted and wants to be reviewed but needs a follow-up, tracking the state of review drafts, and so on. But it's starting to be a pinch point (part of the problem is different field editors can potentially contact the same reviewee or reviewer -- they want something more unified that anyone can query and track statuses). Short of building their own database system to track everyone, are there other solutions that already exist in managing people and content for journals? I've looked at system like Annotum and Edit Flow, but I don't think they're quite what they need. It doesn't need to be built on top of WordPress, either. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any thoughts? Would Drupal serve as a better alternative? Should we build something from the ground-up?
