			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear Rebecca,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Zotpress can display a collection with the following syntax: [zotpress collection=''   '']. You can see more in the help tab of your zotpress installation.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;BUT Zotpress' performances are rather bad and can slow down your whole website (mine is slow because of zotpress, but nobody reads it, so it does not really matter). So, maybe Mark Sample's instructions are still the best way to do what you want to do.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Best,&#60;br /&#62;
Frédéric
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Some of making this kind of thing work would probably involve installing new WordPress plugins and/or altering the PHP on the page. Searching in the WordPress forums might help - here's something that might be relevant: &#60;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/import-and-display-rss-feeds-on-front-page&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/import-and-display-rss-feeds-on-front-page&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Alas, I don't know of any newer solutions that have been built. But, I do know that relatively recently there has been a lot of work on the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/server_api/read_api&#34;&#62;Zotero API&#60;/a&#62;, and Faolan Cheslack-Postava built a &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/server_api#api_implementations&#34;&#62;PHP library&#60;/a&#62;, so if any developers or hackers want to tackle this, you'll have much better tools at your disposal.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sorry to re-open this old can of worms, but I'm currently trying to embed a Zotero bibliography into a WordPress page, and all of the solutions I come across are from 2009-2010 (mostly responding to Mark Sample's epic post). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm wondering if anybody on this thread might have come across some other, better solution between then and now. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've tried Zotpress, but unless I'm much mistaken, the bibliographies that result will be static (won't update themselves based on new items added to Zotero as time goes on). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Is there anything out there that would combine the pretty metadata you get when you use Zotpress, with automatic updating? Is the Yahoo Pipes solution still the only way for this to work? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And, finally, is there anything out there that can also paginate a bibliography - display items in ten-item pages, say, rather than dumping everything into one monstrously long page or restricting the list to ten items? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;None of this may exist! But thank you in advance for your input. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Rebecca

			<description>&#60;p&#62;lol @&#60;a href='/profile/mwidner'&#62;mwidner&#60;/a&#62;, I thought of writing you, but then I thought a public answer could be more useful to more people. I also couldn't find your email on the google surface. I tried a DM, but my tweetdeck froze. Alas, it is for the best. Now all DH searches for zotero can lead them to what turned out to be a handy post.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Well, since you didn't want to write me, I'll just answer you here. :) I followed this guide:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zachwhalen.net/blog/09/aug/recently-zoteroed-drupal-approach&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.zachwhalen.net/blog/09/aug/recently-zoteroed-drupal-approach&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Since I'm enamored of Drupal, that's my solution of choice. The only change I had to make was to add a filter to the view that doesn't display entries with an accession number. For some reason it was including those, too, in the feed.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A few extra points: Views is by far one of the most powerful modules for Drupal. Once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly useful.&#60;br /&#62;
The RSS feed for Zotero is woefully inadequate in metadata terms. There are no tags for basic things like author, publication date, and journal. I wish they would change that.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Excellent! Thanks, folks! Choices, choices... hmmm I've always wanted to understand pipes.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A while ago I worked on &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.patrickgmj.net/node/178&#34;&#62;a WordPress widget to show a Zotero library&#60;/a&#62;. It's been a while since I've given it much attention, and it doesn't use the APIs that are now available. I've also been told by Amanda French and others that it tends to slow the page load time way down.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Jeremy Boggs has put together a PHP library called &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clioweb/phpZotero&#34;&#62;PHPZotero&#60;/a&#62; that can be helpful for more general purposes.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I run an RSS feed of both my Zotero library and Delicious links onto my Wordpress blog. To put the two together, I followed Mark Sample's instructions on &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.samplereality.com/2009/07/29/on-hacking-and-unpacking-my-zotero-library/&#34;&#62;&#34;On Hacking and Unpacking my (Zotero) Library&#34;&#60;/a&#62; to put Yahoo! Pipes to good use.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With Pipes, you're also able to filter out somethings that may not be useful for your blog or readers.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you have a WordPress site you can use the fetch_feed tag, or there are a number of plugins you could use if you're not comfortable with editing template files, such as RSS in Page.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Lately, I've noticed that questions have been very general and grandiose, so I thought I would take it back to the mundane a bit by trying out a technical question. The question itself is a bit of an experiment also, since I imagine it belongs more on the Zotero forum. I'm wonder what kind of productive overlap we can have between the two forums. The question came about after I saw &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mwidner&#34;&#62;@&#60;a href='/profile/mwidner'&#62;mwidner&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/a&#62; posted a link to &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelwidner.com/courses/e314lspring2011&#34;&#62;a new course&#60;/a&#62; where he will be using a zotero feed of his student's collaborative bibliography. I figure I could write to him, or play with the RSS until I figure it out, but then I thought an answer here would be more useful to the larger community. I will be happy to answer my self if I figure it out tonight, but if you have a ready answer feel free.
