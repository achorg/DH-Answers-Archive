			<description>&#60;p&#62;At Carleton College, we will go to 5.4 when we start deploying Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 this summer. Unless required to by a critical app, we'll tend to stay with the distro default. If Red Hat 7 didn't ship it, we probably would have used Red Hat Software Collections to run 5.4, but only because Moodle 2.8 was going to force us into it. For smaller projects, we might have chosen a different plan.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;On Redhat 6.5 we have 5.3.3&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On Ubuntu 14.04 we have 5.5.9.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It probably varies a lot over the library domain, considering the variety of Linux distributions and versions of each. Ubuntu 14.04 has PHP 5.5 in their repository. In a perfect world, all library servers would be running a Linux OS that self-upgrades from one version to the next and has a package manager. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would just go ahead and start using PHP 5.4. It's usually not difficult to upgrade PHP versions on a server. There will probably always be servers running software that's 10+ years old, but I don't think you should let that hold back your development.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Looks like our central VM group at Berkeley offers Red Hat 5.9, Red Hat 6.4, and CentOS5.4, none of which use PHP 5.4 by default, at least.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;PHP 5.4 offers some nice features for developers, but if university libraries or other institutions are slow to get onto 5.4, it'll hold back the versions we develop with. (It looks like most hosting companies at least make 5.4 available.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, anyone have a sense of whether higher ed and cultural heritage orgs have moved up to PHP 5.4 on their servers?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;thanks
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
