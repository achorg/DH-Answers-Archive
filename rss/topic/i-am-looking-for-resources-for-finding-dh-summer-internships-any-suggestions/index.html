&#60;p&#62;Junior Fellows Summer Intern Program Mission&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Library of Congress Junior Fellows Summer Intern program (10 weeks) offers undergraduate and graduate students insights into the environment, culture and collections of the world's largest and most comprehensive repository of human knowledge. Through the Junior Fellows program, the Library of Congress furthers its mission to provide access to a universal record of human knowledge and creativity as exemplified by its collections, while supporting current and future generations of students and scholars. The interns explore digital initiatives and inventory, catalog, arrange, preserve and research a backlog of copyright or special collections materials in many different formats in various divisions.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is a good question.. I can't now recall seeing postings for DH internships before on the usual lists like Humanist-L (though a search through their archive shows that there were some posted now and again &#60;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/xteGeX)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://bit.ly/xteGeX)&#60;/a&#62;. Then again, when someone did contact me about a possible DH internship (it only happened once) during my tenure at Humanities Computing in Chicago I was pleasantly surprised and very happy to make something happen for that student. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My advice is to contact institutions directly with a set of possible areas of interest. To get started you could trawl the list of past NEH Office of Digital Humanities (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.neh.gov/ODH/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.neh.gov/ODH/&#60;/a&#62;) grant awardees for the DC area. If it's a short-term internship (say, for the summer) they may well be able to find funding for it somewhere at short notice. The other approach may be to join the Humanist list (&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/&#60;/a&#62;) and then post your request there.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You might consider the Library of Congress Junior Fellows Summer Intern Program.  &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.loc.gov/hr/jrfellows/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.loc.gov/hr/jrfellows/&#60;/a&#62; . According to the site, the announcement about the 2012 application cycle should be announced soon.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What are your academic interests?  Digital humanities is a large grab bag; it would help to know what sorts of tasks you would like to learn or do.
