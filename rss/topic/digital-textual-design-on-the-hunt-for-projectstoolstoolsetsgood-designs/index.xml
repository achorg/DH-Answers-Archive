			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello all,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm on the hunt for projects/tools/toolsets/good designs that are involved with the digital replication of texts, creating a range of ways to search, interact with, browse and investigate any text. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am based at the university of durham, and what we hope this will enable us to identify are new forms of digital curating and scholarly ‘good practice’.  Our aim is to be able to outline the important underlying principles for anyone interested in discovering and editing versions of physical texts as a digital entity.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone know of any technologies that we should incorporate into our research?... Or other similar projects / interesting people we should contact?... As part of a larger research we'd like to interview anyone involved with this kind of work - as a Curator, designer etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks terribly in advance.&#60;br /&#62;
Mariann
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
