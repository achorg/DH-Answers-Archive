			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/jennriley'&#62;jennriley&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-do-you-want-full-text-provided-to-you-for-analysis#post-1893&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My model repository would be &#60;a href=&#34;http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/&#34;&#62;Chronicling America;&#60;/a&#62; the Library of Congress did a very nice job assembling linked open data on a hierarchical set, and (now) allowing updated downloads of the full corpus. And it's possible to just pull one article at a time without any fuss—anything that creates a low barrier to entry (using JSON as well as XML for metadata, for example) helps. Plus they have a nice suits of additional APIs (for snipped image data, for example)—obviously a smaller project won't want to do all of them, but some might be available.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm a fan of HathiTrust's system. They have .zip files for each volume, with pages stored as separate .txt files within the zip. Then they have metadata for each volume as a .json object. Multiple volumes that are part of the same &#34;work&#34; (or I suppose, ms collection) can be linked via a record id.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;All of this is available (as copyright permits) via an API.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Of course, this system would require some adaptation to apply to mss. But I'm mentioning HathiTrust as an example because I think it's going to be valuable in the long run to aim for &#60;em&#62;some&#60;/em&#62; kind of consistency across repositories.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're in the early planning stages of an initiative that will make available full text for some of our special collections library's manuscript holdings. We'll definitely provide a search interface, but we'd also like to allow the full text of these resources to be downloaded for researchers to use in text mining and whatever other applications suit their fancy. As a researcher doing this kind of work, what's the most useful way for us to make this full text available to you? One big download? Something else? Are there examples out there of sites that do this particularly well that we should model our capabilities after?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for your input!&#60;br /&#62;
Jenn
