			<description>&#60;p&#62;The link that Brett provided gives superb advice. Try to get started early so the people at the granting office are able to read and critique your draft proposal. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, ask about the success rates for the grant for which you are applying. Some grant opportunities (such as the NEH ODH grants) are far more competitive than others and the granting agencies do not always do a good job of telling you that up front (I am looking at you, NEH!). As a new grant writer you should focus on the low-hanging fruit.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;These are all excellent tips!  I would also recommend Lisa Spiro's blog post on this topic from a little while back:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tips on Writing a Successful Grant Proposal&#34;&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2008/09/09/tips-on-writing-a-successful-grant-proposal/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2008/09/09/tips-on-writing-a-successful-grant-proposal/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Lastly, I remind you that in ODH we really like lasers and helicopters.  Any project.  But with lasers.  And helicopters.  Maybe lasers mounted on sharks.  Flying in helicopters.  ;)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;And don't forget -- if it's an NEH ODH grant you're going for -- to send it in for comment by the program officers as early as possible (well before the six-week deadline, if you can).  Their guidance is invaluable.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Its also important to look at grants that weren't successful - if you can get context (from the PI) as to why they failed (based on reviewer response), even better!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I second Ethan's suggestion -- for me, nothing has been more helpful than looking at examples of successful grants in the programs in which I'm applying.  (No, scratch that: actually the MOST helpful thing was serving as a reviewer on NEH panels for various grant programs.  You see such a variety of proposals and begin looking at them with a reviewer's eye, that when you come to write your own, you are doing so with excellent models and a very practically-grounded list of pitfalls in mind!)  So if you're invited to serve, say yes!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Barring that, I do recommend looking at the successful grant narratives that are often posted alongside announcements and forms. Once you're writing for a specific grant program, I'd also encourage you to post here, asking if past grantees are willing to share their narratives and budgets.  I'm happy to show you what my group has done recently for Mellon and in the IATDH and SUG categories at NEH!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/patrickmj'&#62;patrickmj&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-do-i-get-started-learning-how-to-write-a-successful-grant#post-132&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would also suggest looking at other proposals (both successful and unsuccessful).  Most public granting agencies have model proposals that you can download an look at.  Also, I'm sure there are members of this community that would be more than happy to share some proposals with you.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It's hard to give very much general advice about this, since there's a lot of difference from one agency or foundation to the next, but here are some things that apply broadly: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Write for an educated but general audience: even if you assume that the proposal will be reviewed by members of your discipline, don't assume that they will understand what you do or why it is important. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Grants are generally given to solve problems and/or advance our understanding in some area.  Make sure that the problem you're addressing hasn't already been solved by someone else (e.g., demonstrate knowledge of relevant literature), and make sure that you clearly explain the importance of addressing it, as well as the promise of your approach.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Make sure everything in your budget is accounted for in your proposal, and (even more important) make sure that any actual work you propose to do is clearly represented in your budget.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Obey grant guidelines, especially with respect to requirements and limitations. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Understand the goals of the funder in the grant program to which you're applying, and explain how the work you want to do connects with and advances those goals.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The most common failings of bad proposals, in my experience, are failures to observe one or more of those rules.  Beyond that, useful advice would need to address the local cultures, dialects, and practices of a particular agency or foundation.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We have lots of great ideas at my university, but no real grants office with expertise and guidance about grant-writing. So, where would I look for guidance about how to get started? I know Brett and Jen at NEH-ODH are super-helpful with giving suggestions and they have examples and info. Any other places I might start?
