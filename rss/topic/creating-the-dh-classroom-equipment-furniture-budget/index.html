			<description>&#60;p&#62;We just renovated a physics lab into a SCALE-UP format room. I'll digitize our plans and send 'em along to your gmail, if that's ok.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I will say this: The thing that people talked about the most during planning was literally the tables: what was the right size and shape to accommodate group work; to allow for free-and-easy movement around the tables, including up-and-down to the ubiquitous walltalker writing surfaces, etc. That took a lot of effort.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It has been pretty cool, though.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The folks at University of Mary Washington just opened &#60;a href=&#34;http://convergence.umw.edu/&#34;&#62;a shiny new building with lots of digital classroom space&#60;/a&#62;. You might be able to reach out to their &#60;a href=&#34;http://academics.umw.edu/dtlt/&#34;&#62;Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies&#60;/a&#62; for ideas and what they budgeted.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello - I am writing a proposal to renovate a traditional, fixed seating computer lab as a SCALE-UP style classroom suitable for teaching DH (among other things). What do you suggest for set up? Furniture, laptops, monitors, budget for software, etc. If anyone has a classroom and budget for a similar project, that would be especially helpful. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Caroline
