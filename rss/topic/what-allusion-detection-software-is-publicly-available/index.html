			<description>&#60;p&#62;Have just come across this post - I don't think you'll find anything very sophisticated &#34;off the shelf,&#34; but if this is still a problem for your student, send me a note about it. I'm currently working on some quotation/allusion identification problems with poems and dictionaries, and may be able to help.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;No firsthand knowledge, but from time to time I've thought about trying to get &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/viewArticle/190/235&#34;&#62;Philomine/PhiloLogic&#60;/a&#62; running--it's posted the code base and should be downloadable--anyone know more about that?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I know that various research teams are working on allusion detection strategies that will identify direct quotations and paraphrases in a given corpus of texts. Some of these strategies will even work on texts in different languages, which is often relevant for medievalists.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My question is this: is there anything out there available &#60;em&#62;now,&#60;/em&#62; off the shelf? I'm working with a graduate student in medieval studies who has a specific problem involving the interrelationship of four texts. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I believe the texts are not all in the same language, but we might be able to get all or most of them in English translation as a somewhat hacky solution. My guess is that tools of this kind are still vaporware or dreamware -- but I thought I would try...
