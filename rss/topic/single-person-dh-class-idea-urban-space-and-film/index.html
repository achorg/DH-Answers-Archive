			<description>&#60;p&#62;Perhaps the quickest way to get started would just be with Google Maps; by using the &#34;My Places&#34; feature you can set the bounds of your map, share it with students, and they can then set placemarks which will allow them to associate text, image, and video (it will all be downloadable to Google Earth as well, where you can then leverage already existing overlays such as community-based galleries, 3D models, etc.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://support.google.com/maps/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#38;amp;answer=62843&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://support.google.com/maps/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#38;amp;answer=62843&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Another site to at least check out would be HistoryPin (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.historypin.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.historypin.com&#60;/a&#62;) -- definitely geared more towards historical analysis, but still includes all the features you're interested in.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you've got the bent to do something yourself, Omeka would work for you if you utilized the Neatline plugins (recently released by UVa's Scholars Lab). &#60;a href=&#34;http://neatline.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://neatline.org&#60;/a&#62;
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Advice needed re: individual (class)project on urban space and films.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am a newbie who knows of omeka.net, for example.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What I'd like to do is take a particular urban area, map it out (in 3d if possible, a la google earth views with 3d building modelling), and create a collaborative space where students could then upload images and their own writings relating to individual buildings and their filmic representation.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;How can I do this with no budget / by myself as the professor (a humanities professor with little relevant technology experience but some degree of aptitude / without terrible effort.??&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I doesn't look like omeka.net would work on its own from the omeka sites I've seen...
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
