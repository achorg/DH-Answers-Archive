			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is actually a problem we have been wrestling with, and one of the inspirations of the &#60;a href=&#34;http://praxis.scholarslab.org/&#34;&#62;Praxis Program&#60;/a&#62; we started here at UVa. The approach is really to teach how to management and implement a digital humanities project from the ground up, including the programming, budget management, and implementation aspects of a code. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The way we've approached the programming is to teach how to think like a developer; our examples are in Ruby, but we could have just as easily done them in PHP, JavaScript, Python, or even C... We've focused a lot of attention on recognizing when to use particular coding principals (flow-control, looping, etc.), and a lot of muscle memory (e.g. exercises). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For teaching Python, Zed Shaw's &#60;a href=&#34;http://learnpythonthehardway.org/&#34;&#62;Learn Python the Hard Way&#60;/a&#62; is a good resource (actually all of the &#60;a href=&#34;http://learncodethehardway.org/&#34;&#62;Learn Code the Hard Way&#60;/a&#62; series is pretty good). I have also seen a lot of new developers respond well to the various Koans out there (e.g. &#60;a href=&#34;https://bitbucket.org/gregmalcolm/python_koans/wiki/Home&#34;&#62;Python Koans&#60;/a&#62;).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'll throw in a few other really good (and free) resources we've used in this program too:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* &#60;a href=&#34;http://eloquentjavascript.net/&#34;&#62;Eloquent JavaScript&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
* &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Git_for_dummies&#34;&#62;Git for Dummies&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
* &#60;a href=&#34;http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/&#34;&#62;Git - the simple guide&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
* &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/&#34;&#62;Getting Started with HTML&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
* &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/learning&#34;&#62;Learning CSS: Cascading Style Sheets articles and tutorials&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
* &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/&#34;&#62;Responsive Web Design&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Depending on what you're wanting to do, it may also be beneficial to use something like &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.r-project.org/&#34;&#62;R&#60;/a&#62; to teach programming. This may look scarier (it is for quantitative analysis), but it does provide many of the same controls and approaches used in other realms of development, but within a limited domain. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;HTH,&#60;br /&#62;
Wayne

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm curious about the choice of Python, actually. Any particular reason for choosing it?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If not, I'd actually suggest Javascript instead. That way people can look at HTML/CSS/Javascript right in their browser with firebug or whatever in-browser tool is there. I also like Javascript because it is easy to do direct, kinda fun, manipulations of a web page, especially if you modify Greasemonkey scripts. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The upshot strategy is that JS lets students get higher payback for their learning more quickly.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;HTH
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Perhaps &#60;a href=&#34;http://niche-canada.org/member-projects/programming-historian/ch1.html&#34;&#62;The Programming Historian&#60;/a&#62; would be of help?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you care to go the TEI route at all, &#60;a href=&#34;http://tbe.kantl.be/TBE/&#34;&#62;TEI By Example&#60;/a&#62; is pretty fabulous.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For HTML, have a look at &#60;a href=&#34;http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html&#34;&#62;Dive Into HTML5&#60;/a&#62; and see if it floats your boat. If not, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.w3schools.com/&#34;&#62;w3schools&#60;/a&#62; may be closer to what you need.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, does anyone know of any resources for teaching a short unit of a larger DH course on programming for graduate students? I'd like students to have basic skills in HTML/CSS/Python - but maybe that's asking too much. Any strategies?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
