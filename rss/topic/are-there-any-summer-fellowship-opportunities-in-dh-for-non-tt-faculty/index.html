			<description>&#60;p&#62;The NEH grant program &#34;Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities&#34; funds a variety of opportunities that do just what you are looking for. Funded projects set their own acceptance criteria, but most over the years have accepted a good mix of tenure track faculty, alt-ac faculty, independent scholars, post docs, grad students, etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The projects awarded recently (including upcoming projects) can be found here: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?q=1&#38;amp;n=0&#38;amp;o=0&#38;amp;k=0&#38;amp;f=0&#38;amp;s=0&#38;amp;p=1&#38;amp;pv=260&#38;amp;d=0&#38;amp;y=0&#38;amp;pg=0&#38;amp;ob=year&#38;amp;or=DESC&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?q=1&#38;amp;n=0&#38;amp;o=0&#38;amp;k=0&#38;amp;f=0&#38;amp;s=0&#38;amp;p=1&#38;amp;pv=260&#38;amp;d=0&#38;amp;y=0&#38;amp;pg=0&#38;amp;ob=year&#38;amp;or=DESC&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some have been going for a while, some are starting soon. Each project has its own call for participants, so you'll have to contact the investigators to see about application processes, etc.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For many non-tt faculty, there are few, if any, resources available to them in order to work on developing the skills to (technical or otherwise) to &#34;do&#34; DH. Would it be possible to build off of the DHSI bootcamp model of one week and expand it to opportunities for non-tt academics to collaborate on-site at a DH center/project to be able to really work in DH and learn the tools? I'm really thinking of the opportunity to see what you can do with DH, as well as take the time to learn and immerse themselves in that environemtn.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
