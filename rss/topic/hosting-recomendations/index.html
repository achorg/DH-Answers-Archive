&#60;p&#62;I've been very pleased with Linode so far.  I think Jetty is the most lightweight servlet container going.  It puts up with a lot of abuse before caving in too.  You get more management options with Tomcat and glassfish.

&#60;p&#62;Joyent's been good for digitalhumanities.org, and their helpdesk/customer support is quite responsive when you need it, but their shared hosting doesn't allow java, so we reverse-proxy stuff that requires that from Slicehost.  I'd rate them good if you want web-based administration.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've never had to bug &#60;a href=&#34;http://synhosting.com/&#34;&#62;SYN Hosting&#60;/a&#62; about anything, and that's just the way I like it. No shell access (though slicehosting is coming, I believe), but otherwise, everything you could ask for.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Seconding the recommendation for Bluehost, they have been cheap and easy.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've used Bluehost for a while. There have been a few times that I've been disappointed with their service and customer support, but it's been generally pretty good for the past couple years.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I don't have much experience shared hosting, but I've been very happy with Slicehost (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.slicehost.com/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.slicehost.com/)&#60;/a&#62;. I think in some situations Linode can be a bit cheaper (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.linode.com/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.linode.com/)&#60;/a&#62;. Both do Xen virtualization, which helps guarantee that resources aren't oversubscribed, as often happens with shared hosting. But as you you know, these are shell solutions: you need to build and install your own environment (which really isn't that bad nowadays – it can be more of a hassle to keep up with security updates and so on). In any case, for most Java web apps, I'd probably avoid shared hosting.

&#60;p&#62;Excellent question, Wayne!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have used &#60;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/9m1tI9&#34;&#62;Daily Razor&#60;/a&#62; for many years now (at least 6, maybe more like 8, I'm not sure). These folks have several different configurations of developer hosting packages (and &#34;regular&#34; ones too).  Here's their &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dailyrazor.com/java/overview.php&#34;&#62;Java hosting info&#60;/a&#62; (shared plans start at $6.95/mo, private at $9.95/mo) and &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dailyrazor.com/php/php_ruby_plans.php&#34;&#62;PHP/Ruby info&#60;/a&#62; (shared plans start at $2.95/mo.)  There are various and sundry configurations one can go for, and they are very responsive with support questions. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Current PHP 5.3.13 on my server right now (this is a Daily Razor default) includes bcmath, bz2, calendar, cgi-fcgi, ctype, curl, date, dom, exif, filter, ftp, gd, gettext, hash, htscaner, iconv, json, libxml, mbstring, mcrypt, mhash, mime_magic, mysql, mysqli, openssl, pcre, PDO, pdo_sqlite, pgsql, posix, pspell, Reflection, session, SimpleXML, snmp, soap, sockets, SPL, SQLite, tidy, tokenizer, wddx, xml, xmlreader, xmlrpc, xmlwriter, xsl, Zend Optimizer, zip, zlib&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Others I typically recommend are &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lunarpages.com&#34;&#62;Lunarpages&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://asmallorange.com&#34;&#62;A Small Orange&#60;/a&#62;, for less techie-intense things.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have had good luck with asmallorange for basic web hosting. I did get omeka installed there, but the basic option does not support java servlet containers. For people who want a basic omeka install it might work:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://asmallorange.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://asmallorange.com&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You can start out by buying just a single month, so it is cheap to evaluate, and the service (so far, for me) is top notch.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A question I get asked a lot is to recommend a hosting solution. Most of my experience is with virtual private server (VPS) solutions, but have also used Dreamhost and MediaTemple. Do others have recommendations for free/low-cost web hosting. Specifically, with PHP5 and MySQL support? Additionally, do you have any pointers for low-cost Java Servlet Containers (e.g. Tomcat/Jetty/Glassfish)? A lot of people want to run software we write, but don't have the resources on their campus to implement and support server software like Solr or Geoserver.
