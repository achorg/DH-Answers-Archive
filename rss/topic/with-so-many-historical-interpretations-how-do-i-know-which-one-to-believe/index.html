			<description>&#60;p&#62;My U.S. history students (freshmen and sophomores in college) are reading various accounts of events in U.S. history. Apparently, this is a new experience for them. As high school students, they learned that history was some sort of objective set of facts, dates, and events. Recently, they read several different views about the decision to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Invariably, differing interpretations result in confusion rather than in deeper understanding. How would you answer their question?
