			<description>&#60;p&#62;Seconding Dorothea. Drupal could do this nicely, but it would require a fair amount of care in setting up the site, especially in terms of roles and permissions, and training so people consistently mark changes as new revisions. The &#60;a href=&#34;http://drupal.org/project/diff&#34;&#62;Diff Module&#60;/a&#62; might be extra helpful for wiki-like change tracking.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Erica Hartmann's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/know-of-a-great-web-based-application-that-supports-editorial-workflow#post-903&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You're probably looking for something like Islandora (a Drupal front end with a Fedora Commons back end). &#60;a href=&#34;http://islandora.ca/about&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://islandora.ca/about&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Their website doesn't do Islandora justice, so I would recommend contacting them directly to see what they can do for you. There are a lot more features than what are advertised.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The project is open source GNU. If you do not have developers available to you, and you would like a specific function, they have a team called DiscoveryGarden (for hire) that will build it for you.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Maybe this is too obvious, but... couldn't this be built atop Drupal?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Not fully-baked yet, but they might let you have a look if you ask nicely: &#60;a href=&#34;http://pkp.sfu.ca/omp&#34;&#62;Open Monograph Press&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm developing a digital encyclopedia, and I'm looking for a web-based application that does the following: supports lots of content in multiple formats (text, images, audio, video) from a large number of contributors; collects and stores essential information about contributors; allows multiple editors to review, comment on, and modify content; tracks changes and versions; gives some editors more rights than others; stores content reliably; exports content to Drupal. Certainly, something like this must exist out there. If you know where, please let me know. Thanks! Erica
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
