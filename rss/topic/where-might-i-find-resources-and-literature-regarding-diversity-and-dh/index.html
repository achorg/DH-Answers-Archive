&#60;p&#62;This looks like a great place to start. Thanks for the bibliography.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Okay, well the following will likely fall in the latter category...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Lisa Nakamura's name first comes to mind as she's written a whole bunch of stuff on race and the internet, i.e. her book Digitizing Race: Visual Cultures of the Internet.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Angela Haas wrote a dissertation on the intersection between technology &#38;amp; American Indians: &#34;A rhetoric of alliance: What American Indians can tell us about digital and visual rhetoric,&#34; and she has an article in Computers &#38;amp; Composition Online called &#34;Making Online Spaces More Native to American Indians: A Digital Diversity Recommendation&#34; available here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/Haas/index.htm&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/Haas/index.htm&#60;/a&#62;. I am also a big fan of her article &#34;Wampum as Hypertext: An American Indian Intellectual Tradition of Multimedia Theory and Practice.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Melanie Yergeau is doing really interesting stuff drawing from disability studies on autism and multimodality. I'm not sure what she's published on since I gather this from a conference presentation I saw earlier this year. I wrote a bit about it on the CHI blog, though my description probably really oversimplifies her presentation (see the last couple paragraphs): &#60;a href=&#34;http://chi.matrix.msu.edu/2011/05/06/digital-rhetorics-at-cccc-2011/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://chi.matrix.msu.edu/2011/05/06/digital-rhetorics-at-cccc-2011/&#60;/a&#62; She also has a webtext, &#34;aut(hored)ism&#34; published through Computers &#38;amp; Composition Online here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/dmac/index.html#&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/dmac/index.html#&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Iswari Pandey's &#34;Literate Lives Across the Digital Divide,&#34; published in Computers &#38;amp; Composition, traces the writer's movement between Nepal and the U.S. over time and talks about the relationship between technology and politics across these spaces. He argues that while we often think of access as contingent on things like wealth and status, governmental politics also play a huge role.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Doug Walls has a *fantastic* webtext published in Kairos called &#34;An 'A' word production: A case for mindful rhetorical media use&#34;  &#60;a href=&#34;http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.1/disputatio/walls/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.1/disputatio/walls/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Robyn Tasaka wrote a dissertation that explores racial and ethnic representation on college Hawai'i club websites, titled, &#34;Challenges and privileges, entanglement and appropriation: Rhetorical practices of Asian Americans from Hawai'i&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Other stuff I've come across but not gotten around to reading myself:&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Just for clarification--are you looking for works that talk about diversity, inclusion, and access within DH as a field of study (i.e., works that discuss the backgrounds of folks who identify as DHists and the work that they do)? Or are you also looking for works that deal with issues relevant to DH (though they may not be explicitly situated in DH) that talk about things like technology &#38;amp; race/disability/access/inclusion a bit more generally? Or both?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Coming out of the THATCamp CHNM 2011 diversity, inclusion, and accessibility session, I hope to survey existing resources and literature on these issues in DH. Any help? A search for the keyword &#34;diversity&#34; here on DH Q&#38;amp;A doesn't provide many results - &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/search.php?q=diversity&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/search.php?q=diversity&#60;/a&#62; ...
