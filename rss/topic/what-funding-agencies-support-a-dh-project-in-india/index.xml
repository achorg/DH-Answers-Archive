			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear Patrick and quinnanya:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks a lot for the responses and suggestions to seek funds. I have been exploring opportunities in India for funding, and have come to the conclusion that funding specifically for a dh based project is very minimal. The ones available are through STEM related streams and difficult to tap if you project is not aligned with their objectives. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, I would be looking for project based funding wherein I can break out my larger project into smaller short-term projects. Do keep me posted about any funding opportunities that can be applied for.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks once again&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You might also want to follow and/or get in touch with the DHAsia initiative at Stanford, which seems to have been launched today: &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhasia.org/2015/06/introducing-dhasia/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dhasia.org/2015/06/introducing-dhasia/&#60;/a&#62;. There's not a lot of details available so far, but the geographic scope, at least, includes India.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I get the sense that the vast majority of members and knowledge here is still centered on North America and Europe, so I fear that we might not be a good knowledge-source yet.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Have you asked around at your institution, or among other colleagues that you know in India, about grant sources that they have pursued, but might not be explicitly DH? It's possible that some funding agencies in India do not have a specific emphasis on DH, but would welcome a DH proposal (here in the US, the National Endowment for the Humanities was supporting DH projects before DH was a thing on the virtue of humanities relevance, regardless of technology).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In my experience, different funding sources will or will not provide funds for different things. For example, some will fund digitization work and equipment, some won't. Keep in mind, too, that every applicant for a grant truly believes that their idea is of very high quality. Reviewers will be obligated to assess the quality based on the criteria that are described in the grant application process, so 'quality' will always be measured against each individual program's criteria and guidelines.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the response. While I have been exploring opportunities for funding in India, and have got a small grant (which is yet to materialise) to initiate the project, it would be very beneficial if the grant period is more than 2 years.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Typically I am looking for grants that would cover the following costs:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;a) Infrastructure and Equipment - Computers, Storage, Network setup and Archiving&#60;br /&#62;
b) Travel&#60;br /&#62;
c) Project Associates&#60;br /&#62;
d) Seminars/Conferences/Workshops for taking this project forward&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As far as the quality of the idea goes, I believe that such a project has immense potential in terms of tangible outcomes for researchers and institutions. The first aim is to create an online digital map of exhibition spaces and points, next I would be mapping these areas for elaborating a history of public culture in regional India.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Do let me know if some avenues are available for applying.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hrishikesh&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm not familiar with research funding in India. I presume you are in India?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You're not likely elligible for any national funding from countries other than India. But you would be eligible for various small or independent grants from a range of scholarly societies and charities. Your success would depend on your credentials and the quality of your idea.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To give you a decent answer, I think we'd need to know a bit more about how much money you'd need, and for what.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have initiated a project related to the history of film exhibition and public culture in Indian cities. I am looking to fund this project to expand its applicability, scope and geography. Can someone let me know of any funding agencies who would support this effort?
