			<description>&#60;p&#62;James, I know you're aware of both of these projects, but thought I'd add them to the thread for other readers.  One looks back and is about our constructions of a history of DH and the other is meant to get at contemporary practice (in the practitioners' own words) -- but to my knowledge neither one is involving social scientists and ethnographers in Borgman's sense:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/research/hiddenhistories/&#34;&#62;Hidden Histories: Computing and the Humanities c.1949â€“1980&#60;/a&#62;, at the UCL Centre for Digital Humanities&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;and&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/Day_in_the_Life_of_the_Digital_Humanities&#34;&#62;Day of DH&#60;/a&#62;, or &#34;A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities,&#34; hosted by TAPoR.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Edited to add...&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And of course there's &#60;a href=&#34;http://publicadmin.uvic.ca/aboutUs/FacultyPersonal/siemens.php&#34;&#62;Lynne Siemens' work&#60;/a&#62;. She is in a school for business and information management / public administration at UVic, and her recent work has involved the analysis of collaboration and team-building in DH and digital library projects.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In 2009, writing in Digital Humanities Quarterly (DHQ), Christine L. Borgman asks the question: &#34;Where are the social studies of digital humanities?&#34; as part of an article entitled, &#34;The Digital Future is Now: A Call to Action for the Humanities&#34;. Borgman elaborates, &#34;Why is no one following digital humanities scholars around to understand their practices, in the way that scientists have been studied for the last several decades?  ... The humanities community should invite more social scientists as research partners and should make themselves available as objects of study. In doing so, the community can learn more about itself and apply the lessons to the design of tools, services, policies, and infrastructure.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This year I'm writing a Master's thesis with the current working title of &#34;Towards an Ethnography of the Digital Humanities: A Study of DH and the Future of Research Libraries&#34;.  My focus will be on the histories and futures of CHNM, MITH, and the Scholar's Lab.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any advice, suggested reading, or input is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
