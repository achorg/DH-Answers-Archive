			<description>&#60;p&#62;No, I'm not sure.  I recommend Python because it is often thought of as especially good for teaching the concepts of programming.  You can use that understanding in whatever language is needed for a particular DH task, even if it can't be easily accomplished using Python.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;What language is most useful depends entirely on what kind of research or projects you might pursue. Very broadly speaking, Python is great for lots of data processing, PHP and Javascript for websites, R for statistics.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, to just start with having a little code knowledge, Python is as good a place as any, and there are a lot of DH-oriented guides and tutorials that concentrate on Python.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thank you so much for you help. I will look at the link you send me, and probably through myself into learn how to program. And you are sure that this language is the &#34;best/most useful&#34; for me to learn if I wanna apply for a master i DH?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Each institution of higher education has requirements for admission to its degree programs, and they may vary from one program to another within that institution.  They can also vary across programs within the same institution.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Usually a degree program publicly states any strict requirements for admission, so if courses programming are not listed in the information about the program, it shouldn't be required.  Still, I imagine that experience in programming would be an asset for admission in any case, and more generally in life.  There are lots of free courses available online.  In particular I would recommend a course in Python offered by one of the various MOOC providers.  Here's one offered outside of the major MOOC providers: &#60;a href=&#34;https://online.dr-chuck.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://online.dr-chuck.com/&#60;/a&#62; .

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am currently studying information science, and I really wanna do my master in digital humanities. But if I wanna have any expectations of getting accepted does it mean that I will have to know how to/taken courses in programming?&#60;br /&#62;
The reason why I am asking on here is because I have been calling the university a lot, and no one can answer my question, and I really hope that someone on here can help me.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you for your time and help.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
