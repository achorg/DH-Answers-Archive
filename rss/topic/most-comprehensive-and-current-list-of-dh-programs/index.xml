			<description>&#60;p&#62;International in scope, but the project was a little bit abortive, so it's not a very extensive list.  The idea had been to center only on those programs that offered a formal certificate or degree, which seems like what you're thinking, too...

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Good things come to those who wait – thanks @&#60;a href='/profile/gwijthoff'&#62;gwijthoff&#60;/a&#62; for that useful list!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;@&#60;a href='/profile/nowviskie'&#62;nowviskie&#60;/a&#62;: I think ADHO would be the right place for an international listing of DH programs, though it's not clear to me which branch of the &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/administration&#34;&#62;current structure&#60;/a&#62; might assume this. Another possibility might be &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arts-humanities.net/&#34;&#62;arts-humanities.net&#60;/a&#62;, especially given that they already have an entries-oriented system (great for DH &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arts-humanities.net/jobs/search/results/taxonomy%3A268&#34;&#62;jobs&#60;/a&#62;, for instance). And of course hosting with the ACH would fit well with other emerging scholar initiatives that it's leading. Why don't I ask around a bit and see if there's a good, sustainable way of moving forward. In the meantime, what's the geographical scope of the MLA's current list?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Last year, the MLA's Committee on Information Technology (which I currently chair) began compiling a list of formal DH certificate programs.  We don't think this is something we should publish and maintain long-term, but we're eager to contribute the information we gathered to a bigger, central list, wherever that might emerge.  (Personally, I think either the &#60;a href=&#34;http://ach.org&#34;&#62;ACH&#60;/a&#62; or &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org&#34;&#62;ADHO&#60;/a&#62; site would be a good home for such a thing -- especially if we set up an easy way for people to suggest additions or emendations.)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Stéfan.  I have a running list of digital humanities centers, departments, and working groups &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.delicious.com/stacks/view/RXj9oK&#34;&#62;in a Delicious stack&#60;/a&#62;.  Unfortunately the different kinds of groups aren't differentiated, but maybe it will be of some use in setting up a more comprehensive resource.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Stéfan Sinclair's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/most-comprehensive-and-current-list-of-dh-programs#post-1395&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Good idea, Stéfan. I've collected information about many DH grad &#38;amp; undergrad programs in the Zotero group you mention, but presenting it as a list would be much more coherent and user friendly. I'd be happy to prepare such a list, but I share your question: where would be the best place to post it?  Here? On the ACH, ALLC or ADHO site? On &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/The_CUNY_Digital_Humanities_Resource_Guide&#34;&#62;The CUNY Digital Humanities Resource Guide&#60;/a&#62;? On my blog? Ideally the list would be easy to maintain and update, which suggests a wiki.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It seems to me that maintaining a comprehensive and current list of DH programs should be a high priority for the DH community, especially for outreach to students considering grad and undergrad studies. There's a great summary of &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/DH_Syllabi&#34;&#62;DH syllabi&#60;/a&#62; and a more expansive &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities_education&#34;&#62;Zotero group&#60;/a&#62;, but I'm not sure there's a reliable resource for DH programs (of course, how to define a DH program is a big issue here).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The ALLC's list of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.allc.org/education/seminars-courses&#34;&#62;programs&#60;/a&#62; is very useful. Are there others that are current and fairly complete that you'd recommend?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Where would it make the most sense for such a list to be maintained?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
