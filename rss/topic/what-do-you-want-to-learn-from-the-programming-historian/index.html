			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for these suggestions (and we welcome more!).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd like to invite anyone who would like to contribute lessons on these or any other topics to contact me (adam.crymble@gmail.com). We do write lessons, but we also encourage others to take the opportunity to share what they know or what they'd like to know. Nothing teaches you about a new coding principle faster than having to teach someone else.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We're happy to guide you through the learning process and be as hands-on as you need.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Adam
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;As a big fan of the Programming Historian, I'll echo most of what's been said. I know that I have at times struggled through working with XML. Andrew's suggestion about a discussion of objects makes a lot of sense to me; largely I'd be interested in seeing as much someone's judgement about where building a class makes sense and when it's overkill. (I have some distant memory of building a class POEM which would inherit LITERARY_TEXT and then rapidly suspecting that I was nearing madness). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Topic modeling seems like the hot thing and I appreciated the first Topic Modeling tutorial. I'd love to see a second tutorial on topic modeling (right now I'm trying to look into charting changes in topics over time...)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone do visualization with Python? I have always turned to Processing when I was going to try to generate images...
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been very impressed with the Programming Historian; I'm now through all of the tutorials except the one on topic modeling. I agree with the suggestions above, particularly on parsing xml and using object-oriented techniques. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A couple of additional suggestions:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1. A tutorial on using web services/APIs.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2. Advice on how to handle special characters. I don't know if this would require another tutorial (on character encoding?) or if it would be better to incorporate it into the existing ones. Searching around, there seem to be various methods for dealing with this and I'd find it helpful to get a more general idea of what's going on than the (very helpful, but brief) code snippets I've found in places like Stack Overflow.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I agree with Andrew that the Programming History is great. I could use some help with working with XML. I wrote a program to download all of the UK Hansard (Parliamentary Debates) and I would like to figure out how to parse them better. I can simply strip all of the tags out by adapting earlier lessons and create large text files, but it would be better if I could extract some of the metadata in the XML (particularly the dates). As XML seems like a common database format for digital humanities content, a few basic lessons on working with XML and Python would be a big help.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Programming Historian is fantastic. Definitely helpful to this non-historian humanist.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd love to have lessons that follow on &#60;a href=&#34;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/computing-frequencies&#34;&#62;Computing Frequencies&#60;/a&#62;. Once you have made the word-count list, what are some of the elementary things to do next? How do you normalize the counts reasonably? What is this tf-idf I keep trying to read about on wikipedia? I am thinking that the lesson could show how to do a little math over a big list of data points, and perhaps point out a module or two to import to help with this (maybe installing and importing modules is a lesson in itself).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Another, more programming-centric idea would be to show a little bit more how python's object-oriented features work. Is there a good application for some of its abstraction features for humanists? E.g.: I have a big csv file with 11 columns and a whole lot of rows of text data about some documents. How I get that into a suitable object in python?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Possibly this could go along with: a lesson on python's database connections.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Apologies if these are too random or too specialized or otherwise silly.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Over at the &#60;a href=&#34;http://programminghistorian.org/&#34;&#62;Programming Historian&#60;/a&#62;, we're seeking to add to our collection of lessons, which already covers things like grabbing text from webpages, counting word frequencies, and the basics of topic modeling. We have a lot of ideas about what other lessons we might provide, but we thought we'd ask first: What do you want to learn?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As a humanist (you don't need to be a historian), are there some specific programming tasks you'd like to perform? What are they?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(We find that the lessons work best when they're targeted at accomplishing a particular task, so the more specific the better!)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
