			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm a postdoc fellow, a historian, working on a book manuscript, based on thousands of historical sources in a variety of electronic formats (pdfs, mp4s, images, word docs, etc.).  I have my sources organized logically on my Mac in a hierarchical folder structure.  This method works for the purposes of downloading and storing sources, but not for reorganizing, brainstorming, and writing.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone know of a software package that will leave all my documents where they reside on my hard drive but can link these together in a more permanent, yet still fluid  (non-hierarchical) structure -- kind of like a very complex mind map?  Of course, I could put tags and attach keywords to pull material together.  This method, however, has serious limitations.  So, too, do databases which tend toward hierarchical structures.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have looked at mind mapping software -- the free and cheaper packages -- and all have marked limitations.  I'm working with thousands of PDFs and other sources, which rules out programs designed for smaller projects.  Vue uses a lot of memory even before attaching documents.  Other programs import files; however, my project would measure in the gigabytes if I were forced into going that route.   I want to leave files where they reside on my computer with the capability of reorganizing them visually with links.  Curio does some of this, yet it proved unstable on my system.  A native-Mac program that utilizes its cocoa base, allowing access, for instance, to Quick Look, would be best.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have spent too many hours googling around, trying out various packages on my own, and could really use some assistance.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Miriam,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've been sketching out how I work here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://j.mp/digital-smg&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://j.mp/digital-smg&#60;/a&#62;  But for actual step-by-step workflow, take a look at Bill Turkel: &#60;a href=&#34;http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Has anybody -- particularly in project management or administrative roles in DH -- reached the mystical and possibly mythical state of the paperless office?  Can you recommend software and tools?  Tips or pitfalls?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm looking at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/index.html&#34;&#62;DEVONthink Pro Office&#60;/a&#62; which you can bundle with a bitty scanner for OCR.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I already make pretty good use of &#60;a href=&#34;http://evernote.com&#34;&#62;Evernote&#60;/a&#62; -- desktop, iPhone, and iPad versions.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

				<title>Shane Landrum on "Good, fast metadata management for digital photos of archival items?"</title>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;As a historian working on a dissertation, I'm looking for a good, open-source, Mac-friendly metadata tool for managing the gigabytes of digital photos I've taken of archival materials. Adobe Lightroom's features are close, but it's an expensive piece of software and doesn't solve my problems well. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Mostly, I want a way to add arbitrary metadata to an individual image or batch of images. It might be citation-related (&#34;Every JPG in this folder or its subfolders is from the Jane Texas Papers, and this subfolder is from Box 1...&#34;), subject-related, author-related, or idiosyncratically related to my own research questions. (Think of a sociologist or anthropologist coding interview data.) In an ideal world, it would be able to support a &#34;transcription&#34; field. JPEG/EXIF metadata fields seem unwieldy, not to mention that they're easy to clobber accidentally. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've looked into DSpace as a repository system (and even installed it on my laptop), but it's overkill for single-researcher use at the dissertation level, not to mention a huge amount of work to set up. I don't have access to an institutional DSpace for building my own collections, or else that might be a good answer (from what I know of it).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Really, what I want is a research workflow system for digital reference images. I want to be able to easily, quickly mark and categorize the items in my (very large) collections according to arbitrary categories; find the items I'm looking for using a faceted search; transcribe them in some cases, but not all; know what I haven't looked at yet, but need to; cite the item I'm looking at; etc. Zotero isn't really suited for this, nor is Bookends (my preferred desktop citation manager).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If such a tool doesn't exist for making this process easier, are there established best practices for setting up a home-hacked metadata and workflow system of my own? I've been hacking around with Ruby scripts that store this metadata in nearby text or YAML files, but those haven't worked as well as I'd like.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
