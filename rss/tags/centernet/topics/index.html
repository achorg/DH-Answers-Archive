			<description>&#60;p&#62;There is a lot of talk about the major disciplinary conferences like MLA and AHA having substantial increases in sessions devoted to digital humanities. I am worried/wondering why library associations like ALA (American Library Association) don't seem to be invested in this. Is this true or is it just my perception? Is ALA too big and maybe it is better recognized in the smaller divisions like ACRL (Association of College and Research Libraries)? If librarians are to be active partners in DH work, which professional organizations are supporting and investing in this area?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;My faculty is requesting applications for financial support, and my department is proposing a new centre for digital humanities scholarship. We would start modestly, with a research-seminar series and a couple of computers, and aspire to a Scholars-Lab and CHNM-sized future. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any resources the community could suggest to help with the proposal stage? We have to answer a series of inter-related questions like the purpose and impact of the centre; whom it will serve; why it's current; what our initial budget would be (the really difficult question!); and what external sources of funding we would hope to attract.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
