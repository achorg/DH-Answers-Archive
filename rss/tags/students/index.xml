			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is an issue I have come up against on several occasions recently with metadata standards, particularly linked data ontologies.  My first instinct is to use standards that already exist rather than creating my own ontology to describe concepts.  RDF is so open-ended and flexible that there are an infinite number of ways to do anything, and ontologies are often poorly published.  It would be great if there was a single location that indexed ontologies and metadata standards, making it easier to choose one that suits my needs.  Currently I use Google and ask code4lib.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

Arno, I just saw this â€” thank you, that's very helpful. Do you think enough people are even citing enough digital resources to make that technique useful? Maybe they are! I'll have to give that a shot. I love your idea, too, of searching through the ADHO conference abstracts. Definitely using that one!&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This definitely is a hard task for someone new to DH (and even those with a lot of DH experience, if the disciplinary leap is large). You've already mentioned a lot of excellent places to look. Two other places to include in this list might be the NEH's own &#60;a href=&#34;https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx&#34;&#62;database of past grant awards&#60;/a&#62; and the ADHO &#60;a href=&#34;http://67.207.129.15:8080/dh-abstracts/search&#34;&#62;database of past DH conference abstracts&#60;/a&#62; where such tools &#38;amp; resources could have been presented (with the not insignificant benefit of additional context).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I wonder though, if in the end, it might not be necessary to also approach this problem orthogonally, and search for citations &#38;amp; references to digital tools &#38;amp; resources in full text academic publication databases such as WorldCat or Google Scholar. That way you can see (with caveats, obviously) who is citing and using a resource. These will likely be the more established, respected and widely-used digital resources - precisely the kinds of resources (I am assuming) one would not want to inadvertently overlook. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The biggest difficulty I have with projects such as arts-humanities.net or Bamboo DiRT is that in their perfectly understandable, even necessary, desire to categorize the many available resources on the internet they flatten out and over-simplify the reasons that led to a tool or resource being used (or not used) by teachers/researchers or use categories that are predominantly technical and not closely linked to specific disciplinary practice. In addition, the best tools, which often end up being the best documented tools (via manuals, blog entries, screencasts, howtos, blog entries, reviews..etc) catalog themselves, via Google. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So sure, I'd have the students look at DiRT, at arts-humanities.net and the grant and conference databases, but if possible, I'd also combine this with an attempt to find out what researchers are talking about, what's being cited, what's being used - and try to discover this by deliberately looking in venues that track traditional modes of publication.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

This may be more circular than helpful, but we're working on integrating DHCommons and Bamboo DiRT so that projects that use a given tool appear on that tool's profile in DiRT, and information about the tools (pulled from DiRT) is available when you're browsing DHCommons projects by tool. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, if there's ways we could improve either DHCommons and/or Bamboo DiRT to make it easier for for people to conduct an environmental scan, please let us know.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Those of you who have initiated DH projects are, I'm sure, familiar with the environmental scan, in which one surveys existing projects, both to make sure someone hasn't already done what you're about to do and to see if others have developed technology on which you might build. It's a big part of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/digitalhumanitiesstartup.html#howto&#34;&#62;NEH Office of Digital Humanities start-up grants&#60;/a&#62; (as well as just generally good practice).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;At UCLA, we've been asking our grad students to do environmental scans as part of their final projects, and I've noticed that this can pose a challenge for some of them. Here are the challenges, as I see them:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Students have trouble surveying projects outside their home discipline (e.g., art history projects that may be relevant to students in literature).&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Before they've embarked on the &#34;building&#34; part of their projects, students have trouble understanding what kinds of technology might be relevant to what they're doing (e.g., understanding that what they're about to do is a network visualization).&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;The number of potentially relevant projects is overwhelming.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm thinking of ways I can help them overcome these challenges. So far, this is what I've come up with:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Check various directories of projects (e.g., &#60;a href=&#34;http://arts-humanities.net/project&#34;&#62;arts-humanities.net&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://dirt.projectbamboo.org/&#34;&#62;DiRT&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://spatial.scholarslab.org/&#34;&#62;Spatial Humanities&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org/&#34;&#62;DH Commons&#60;/a&#62;). Still, this can be confusing, because it can be hard for students to tell what they should be looking for.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Ask! Tweet, ask at DH Answers, ask me, ask librarians. However, when the project is in its infancy, it can be difficult for them to articulate it to others.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Those of you who have completed many projects: Do you have an informal checklist that you run through when you embark on something new? What else might I tell these students?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The qualitative text analysis program, MAXQDA, allows you to code and annotate pdf, doc, txt, and rtf files--so it's possible later to search and retrieve across photos, website content, interview transcriptions, academic articles, etc.  There's also a new web-based software called Dedoose that works in a similar way--definitely a tool that could be used to organize digital humanities and multimedia social sciences projects.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Someone mentioned this, sort of, but I've become a believer in Evernote as of late. I can save any type of media, and add comments right in the note, then using tags, organize my notes in folders. In addition to Evernote, and keeping with the simplicity theme, Dropbox is as easy as it gets for syncing and keeping things in order, in my opinion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for a name for the workshop:&#60;br /&#62;

&#60;p&#62;Agreed, manual item by item editing in Omeka is still a drag though it's possible to avoid some of this by keeping one's catalog/metadata in a database or Excel and periodically uploading this to Omeka as CSV.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If these students are interested not only in attaching metadata to digital objects but also annotating these digitally, I recommend qualitative analysis software like NVivo.  (There are surely other options, but this is the one I played around with about eight years ago.)  You can add annotations to various file formats and search across them.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for these excellent answers, y'all! I'm really intrigued by the idea of making your research process public with Omeka, and in a way, it makes a lot of sense, especially with Scripto integration for transcription. But it seems to me that the process of attaching metadata to each archival document individually could be unworkably time-consuming, depending on how much material you have. Plus, maybe it's just my server, but Omeka can be a bit slow to navigate sometimes. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Alex, personally, I do use Zotero to organize my sources, and it works great for me. Still, for some things, it's not totally ideal. For example, it doesn't show you a preview of photographs, so if you have a lot of them, it can be difficult to figure out which one you want. Also, while I would be really cool and organized if I attached metadata to each item, I often return from the archives with hundreds or even thousands of photographs. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One thing students have been asking me about is just managing file sizes, saving things in proper formats, developing naming conventions, and backing up their data. I'm thinking one place to point them is the Library of Congress's information on personal digital archiving. Without trying to turn these students into professional archivists, I'm very interested in hearing what other helpful information is out there.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Now you have me wondering if I'm the only one who uses &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/&#34;&#62;Zotero&#60;/a&#62; to keep track of and annotate all my digital assets. I really don't even use evernote or any kind of note-taker, the note-taking feature in Zotero being good enough. With Zotero you can also attach any file type to a bibliographic entry. In theory and practice, there shouldn't be anything in the dissertation that cannot be assigned to a bibliographic entry. While my system file structure is organized by subject headings that more or less resemble the LOC system, my Zotero is organized by projects, with a folder for unfiled items (always empty).  Each project has a folder for primary sources and one for secondary sources. That is really all I've ever needed.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I like Bill Turkel's workflow, especially the idea of digitizing all documents you will be working with. I work with manuscripts and typescripts often, so I also strive to not only create images of these, but to transcribe them as well. In real life this can only remain a goal to aspire too. If done early and consistently, though, you can get MOST of your materials in the computer, and this is a big +.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There are useful links in Shane Landrum's &#34;Digital Research Methods Roundup&#34; earlier this year: &#60;a href=&#34;http://cliotropic.org/blog/2011/03/digital-research-methods-roundup/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://cliotropic.org/blog/2011/03/digital-research-methods-roundup/&#60;/a&#62; , and an additional follow-up by Chad Black, &#60;a href=&#34;https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/update-on-the-ever-changing-workflow/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/update-on-the-ever-changing-workflow/&#60;/a&#62; . Tim Burke's post on note-taking and suggestions in comments might also give some ideas. &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/2011/07/21/technology-note-taking-and-research-workflow/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/2011/07/21/technology-note-taking-and-research-workflow/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For graduate students who are gathering large, especially image based collections one useful strategy is to setup an Omeka archive. This has a couple of nice side-benefits: first, it'll get their material into a format that they can footnote/cite (Omeka creates the citation link) and along the way force them to tighten up their record-keeping a little. Two, it gives them a standard way to relate items to each other (either via the DC Relation field, or if they're meticulous, via FRBR) in an organized and consistent manner. Third, all metadata is searchable by field and as full-text. This already covers much of what they would want from a locally stored and cataloged collection. Granted this will require a greater degree of organization and discipline up front but it'll pay off dividends later on by attracting others interested in the topic and by generating some early recognition for their expertise. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For a very nice example of this type of set-up, see Radu Suciu's online archive &#60;a href=&#34;http://melancholystories.com&#34;&#62;Medical Case Studies on Renaissance Melancholy&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://radusuciu.posterous.com/&#34;&#62;associated dissertation research blog&#60;/a&#62;.
