			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hmm...sorry if a repost, first attempt failed.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you have access to a plagiarism-detection app, have you tried seeing what that might return? Seems like same or similar algorithms might be appropriate.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been working on a very similar problem with a colleague who wants to identify text reuse among nineteenth-century codes of civil procedure. Here are two sample analyses with code in R, &#60;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/lmullen/24776&#34;&#62;one that calculates similarities between documents and locates them within the document&#60;/a&#62;, and another that &#60;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/lmullen/24945&#34;&#62;creates a comparison matrix&#60;/a&#62; among a small set of documents. The basic method is to break the text up into 5-grams (though this number is arbitrary and could be improved upon) and then calculate the percentage of borrowings and browse them with a keywords-in-context function. The 5-grams work around the problem of minor changes in language or bad OCR. This code is rough still, but for our test corpus of a couple million words, it seems to be performing better than I had expected.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Have you pushed the texts through whatever plagiarism detection apps are available to you (if any)? Seems like those algorithms are close to the ones you are looking for, and so might make a good start.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Browsing the Mathematica online help today, I found that it offers &#60;a href=&#34;http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/SequenceAlignmentAndComparison.html&#34;&#62;several functions for aligning &#38;amp; comparing string sequences&#60;/a&#62;. A web search for #&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/tags/dh'&#62;dh&#60;/a&#62; projects using sequence alignment brought me back here (having completely forgotten that I'd posted a reply to this thread 2 years ago..). See also the following two ARTFL papers &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/conference/programme/abstracts/intertextuality-and-influence-in-the-age-of-enlightenment-sequence-alignment-applications-for-humanities-research.1.html&#34;&#62;one&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/190/235&#34;&#62;two&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You already named two out of three which are the standards. The third is CollateX: &#60;a href=&#34;http://collatex.sourceforge.net/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://collatex.sourceforge.net/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some folks like to use the Versioning Machine: &#60;a href=&#34;http://v-machine.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://v-machine.org/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If your friend is interested in collating really similar images, he/she should check out Sapheos: &#60;a href=&#34;http://sapheos.org/index.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://sapheos.org/index.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For me, collation means similarity as well as difference. Tell your friend mixing it up with matching software provides a different kind of result. I use SuperFastMatch: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mediastandardstrust/superfastmatch&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/mediastandardstrust/superfastmatch&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The important thing is to understand that the algorithm will change the results. Whatever your friend chooses, he/she should be aware of the impact of computational logic on his comparisons. Hope that helps!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For a friend who is studying the manuscripts of John Selden, can anyone recommend collation software?  I see that Collate is still in use, and &#60;a href=&#34;http://juxtasoftware.org&#34;&#62;Juxta&#60;/a&#62; looks promising.  Learning of related projects that use the tool and share techniques would also be helpful.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is the subject of a lot of my current research. The suggestions above are good places to start. I would add the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.juxtasoftware.org/&#34;&#62;Juxta&#60;/a&#62; tool to the mix. Like Ridolfo's, this is a DIFF solution. With texts where the traces are minor or have been moved around, the DIFF breaks down. At the moment we are working with an open source plagiarism detector that will run on a 64-bit Linux machine: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mediastandardstrust/superfastmatch&#34;&#62;SuperFastMatch&#60;/a&#62;. There is no easy web solution yet because of the nature of the computation. The SuperFastMatch library needs all resources in one PC for example. Hope this helps.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hmm. For 1a) you should be able to use the Unix/Linux/OS X terminal tool diff to compare the files. For 1b) you might be able to import the texts into SQL and then do something more complex with mysqldiff. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For 2) you might want to contact MATRIX re: this project: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/2009/12/digging-into-data-challenge-grant-awarded-to-matrix/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/2009/12/digging-into-data-challenge-grant-awarded-to-matrix/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You may find this article on sequence alignment in large text corpora by the folks at ARTFL (&#60;a href=&#34;http://artfl-project.uchicago.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://artfl-project.uchicago.edu/&#60;/a&#62;) useful &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/190/235&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/190/235&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The software ARTFL uses is freely available but its set-up and use remains fairly challenging and has a steep learning curve. Still, the ARTFL team is nothing if not friendly and would, I'm sure, be willing to jump in and assist if you think their tools would be of use for your project as well.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I want to do two different sorts of text comparison, though I suspect the answer for one will apply for the other. Ideally, I'll find a web-based or freeware solution to one or both of the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1. I want to see how much of an early text (a published article, in this case) was lifted and republished in a later one (a book chapter). Being able to find verbatim reuse of paragraphs, sentences, or even strings of words (&#38;gt;5 or so) would be very useful. Both texts have already been identified (i.e. I don't need to search across texts to find candidates for comparison - though that would be nice for the future!), and the ultimate goal is to highlight, in the more recent text, those portions that came from the earlier one. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A side interest (which seems like it would follow from the above) would be to find moments were specific words, examples, or references were swapped out for others. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2. Expanding on the former, I'd like to be able to take the entire set of texts by a given author published before a certain date and find, as before, portions lifted and republished in a text published on that date (a large book, known to have been cobbled together from previous work, for which the MS is unknown and so finding provenance of various passages has proven laborious). Corpus size is obviously larger here, and representing/listing the relevant portions of lifted text is more complicated because they would each be tagged, ideally, as belonging to specific prior texts. Generating a list of passages from the recent text that listed (a) their location in the new text, (b) the earlier text in which they appeared, and (c) their location in the earlier text would be ideal.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any idea?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Note #1: All the relevant texts are pre-1923 and available in relatively-clean text files (or can be turned into them).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Note #2: I poked around before posting – the closest thread I found is &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-way-to-display-and-compare-multiple-editions-of-a-songbook-on-the-web#post-1224http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-way-to-display-and-compare-multiple-editions-of-a-songbook-on-the-web#post-1224&#34;&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;, though the focus there is music notation.

&#60;p&#62;For what it's worth, the Machyn project (which I orchestrated) has a &#34;bookbag&#34; feature, but it doesn't actually save search results.  It saves brief citations to particular bibliographic items in the digital collection, but the Machyn collection only has two items, so it's not really useful.  However, the search interface remembers your search history for that browser session, so you can, in fact, look back at your recent searches.

&#60;p&#62;There's St. Patrick's Confessio Hyperstack project at the Royal Irish Academy / Digital Humanities Observatory (&#60;a href=&#34;http://dho.ie/confessio)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dho.ie/confessio)&#60;/a&#62;. The site is not live yet but I have seen it in action and it might be useful. Write to Franz Fischer (f.fischer AT ria.ie) for more information.
