			<description>&#60;p&#62;I want to do two different sorts of text comparison, though I suspect the answer for one will apply for the other. Ideally, I'll find a web-based or freeware solution to one or both of the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1. I want to see how much of an early text (a published article, in this case) was lifted and republished in a later one (a book chapter). Being able to find verbatim reuse of paragraphs, sentences, or even strings of words (&#38;gt;5 or so) would be very useful. Both texts have already been identified (i.e. I don't need to search across texts to find candidates for comparison - though that would be nice for the future!), and the ultimate goal is to highlight, in the more recent text, those portions that came from the earlier one. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A side interest (which seems like it would follow from the above) would be to find moments were specific words, examples, or references were swapped out for others. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2. Expanding on the former, I'd like to be able to take the entire set of texts by a given author published before a certain date and find, as before, portions lifted and republished in a text published on that date (a large book, known to have been cobbled together from previous work, for which the MS is unknown and so finding provenance of various passages has proven laborious). Corpus size is obviously larger here, and representing/listing the relevant portions of lifted text is more complicated because they would each be tagged, ideally, as belonging to specific prior texts. Generating a list of passages from the recent text that listed (a) their location in the new text, (b) the earlier text in which they appeared, and (c) their location in the earlier text would be ideal.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any idea?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Note #1: All the relevant texts are pre-1923 and available in relatively-clean text files (or can be turned into them).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Note #2: I poked around before posting – the closest thread I found is &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-way-to-display-and-compare-multiple-editions-of-a-songbook-on-the-web#post-1224http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-way-to-display-and-compare-multiple-editions-of-a-songbook-on-the-web#post-1224&#34;&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;, though the focus there is music notation.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For a friend who is studying the manuscripts of John Selden, can anyone recommend collation software?  I see that Collate is still in use, and &#60;a href=&#34;http://juxtasoftware.org&#34;&#62;Juxta&#60;/a&#62; looks promising.  Learning of related projects that use the tool and share techniques would also be helpful.

				<title>Arno Bosse on "Best Practices and Models for Digital Scholarly Collections"</title>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm currently working on developing a model or concept for a online scholarly collection. I'm particularly interested in hearing from people in the DH community about possible models or best practices in this area. It'll help if I provide a little more context about the project's goals. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The author's 18/19th C. works are fairly varied and consist of texts in multiple editions &#38;amp; languages and draw heavily on natural science &#38;amp; anthropological collections. The overall aim of the digital collection is to offer a foundation for what in German is called &#34;rezeptionsgeschichtliche Forschung&#34; - that is to say, a scholarly edition in the service of tracking its intellectual reception. As such, the (i.e. our) digital collection should serve three goals:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;- electronic editions of the author's works&#60;br /&#62;
- critical commentary to the electronic editions&#60;br /&#62;
- temporal, formal, structural and content based contexts &#38;amp; parallels&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's a list of existing digital scholarly editions I've looked at so far which have proven to be valuable and interesting as potential models in this respect - some in some aspects, some in others (in no particular order):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Newton Project (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/&#60;/a&#62;)&#60;br /&#62;

A London Provisioner's Chronicle (&#60;a href=&#34;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/machyn/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/machyn/&#60;/a&#62;)&#60;br /&#62;

Dante’s Commedia (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.sd-editions.com/Commedia/index.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.sd-editions.com/Commedia/index.html&#60;/a&#62;)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Are there any other sites you can recommend I look at? At present, we're thinking that the Darwin Correspondence Project and the Van Gogh Letters are probably closest in concept and presentation to what we had in mind. However I'm very interested in additional examples, especially those drawing on natural science and social science collections.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Second, with respect to formal guidelines, best practices and so forth I'm aware of the MLA Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly Editions (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_scholarly/cse_guidelines)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_scholarly/cse_guidelines)&#60;/a&#62;. Does anyone know of any other texts of this kind? I'm quite new to this area so it's more than likely I've missed something important I could be looking at as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;very many thanks in advance,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Arno&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;ps. I posted this under &#34;Interfaces, Design &#38;amp; Usability&#34; since this seemed closest to my question. Perhaps we should instead start a new DH Answers topic on Digital Editions?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm trying to help a scholar who'd like to create a website that can do two things:&#60;br /&#62;
1) Display a digitized songbook; and&#60;br /&#62;
2) Allow the user to see differences among multiple editions of this songbook.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As one might imagine, this songbook includes both musical notation and text. Currently, the images are (I believe) PDFs.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm thinking this sounds Juxta-ish, but can Juxta be deployed on the Web? What would you do? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
