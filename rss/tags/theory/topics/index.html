			<description>&#60;p&#62;I would like to interrupt our regularly scheduled questioning here at DH Answers and get a little meta. DH Answers is a fantastic resource, but it tends to be very tool and tech centric, and I wonder it isn't time to find ways of facilitating other types of non-totally-unrelated discussion here. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Recently, some really great discussions have been happening on Twitter and sites like &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhpoco.org/&#34;&#62;DH Poco&#60;/a&#62; that have arisen in response to more social, political, and cultural questions, events, prompts, and provocations in relation to DH. I feel that some of these questions—of gender, labor, disciplinarity, and others—might be even more illuminating when embedded within other, more dominant, discourses, like those around available tools, technologies, and methodologies. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I also think that, due to issues of scope and scale on Twitter and the epic-scrolling and searching that needs to happen to stay up-to-date on the latest of 150+ blog post comments, we might need to seek out a better mechanism for supporting these important discussions. I don't mean to say these discussions shouldn't be happening anywhere and everywhere—of course they should!—but I also think that the way DH Answers was originally set up makes folks less likely to bring these types of discussion here. (Or maybe it's something else entirely? Discuss!)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For instance, a quick look at the categories one has to choose from when posting a question (this one is filed under &#34;About DHAnswers&#34; which may or may not makes sense) reveals how much we are privileging technical questions about tools and technologies, and while there's certainly nothing wrong with that (the tools and tech, not so much the privileging) it unfortunately, I'd argue, suggestively narrows the conversation considerably. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;1 Year Ago&#34; Matthew Kirschenbaum asked the DH Answers community, &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/should-dhers-accept-militarydefense-funding#post-1239&#34;&#62;&#34;Should DHers accept military/defense funding?&#34;&#60;/a&#62; which he tagged with, among other things, &#34;ethics&#34; (not a single &#34;Popular Tag&#34; explicitly deals with any of these &#34;other&#34; issues). It was also filed under the category &#34;Project Management &#38;amp; DH Profession,&#34; which seems to be the catch-all for questions that don't fit strict the limitations of the tech-centric discourse. I think the question Matthew raises, due to everything from recent events (see: PRISM) to the history of humanists working in military research, makes this a very pertinent and important question worth exploring, especially in this particular digital space. And while before and after that post there have been several of a more political or ethical nature, there have not been many, and that seems, at the very least, worthy of concern and some discussion.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, LONG STORY SHORT, I'd like to see what others think about this by asking the following questions (along with all of those implicitly and explicitly raised above): (1) Can and should DH Answers be a place for social, cultural, political, etc. discussion (as it seems it at times has been)? (2) What types of categories can we add that would make folks more comfortable feeling such questions are welcome? (3) How can we continue to further integrate discussions happening in other venues—Twitter, DH Poco, personal blogs, MLA Commons, etc.—with DH Answers?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Are there any writings on the relationship between lexicography, discourse analysis, and text/data mining?  As I continue work on a keyword-specific project, I'm wondering where the theoretical, historical, and methodological overlaps are in these various ways of mapping epistemology through language.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are tons of questions one can ask between these fields, but I'm thinking in particular about whether something like the peaks and valleys in a frequency analysis constitute the rise and fall of a Foucauldian &#34;discursive regularity.&#34;  I recently saw &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/661645&#34;&#62;Bernard Geoghegan's piece in Critical Inquiry&#60;/a&#62; on enthusiasm for cybernetics research among French structuralists (a history he argues is important to visit in light of today's digital revolutions in the humanities), but it raises more questions than answers, wonderful as they are.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any leads would be much appreciated!

				<title>aearhart on "Doing DH v. Theorizing DH"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/doing-dh-v-theorizing-dh#post-436</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Here is my latest thinky thought:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've noticed that there is increasing tension between hands on, applied DH work and those who are theorizing DH.  I've heard more than one digital humanist complain about &#34;interlopers&#34; who have never participated in a collaborative project, tagged a text, or used a visualization tool.  I've heard the reverse as well.  Those who only create tools aren't really digital humanists, as they haven't theorized their work within the context of humanities and technology.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I think this is an important issue to discuss, hence my post!    I've always thought of my applied work as a laboratory for the theoretical work I'm interested in pursuing.  The really fruitful work happens in the intersection of the application/methodology and theory.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Perhaps the increased tension in the field is fear of  DH being moved away from a group that has tried to develop new, collaborative models of non-competitive work?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any thoughts on this are welcome!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks,&#60;/p&#62;
