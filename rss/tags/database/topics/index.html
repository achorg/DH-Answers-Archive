			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking into platforms that can be used as an editorial management system for a project I'm providing assistance with. I'm working with a faculty member who is publishing reviews of dissertations with WordPress. The challenge he and his co-editor are having is with their system for keeping track of editors, people contacted for review, and the state reviews are in. They have a large editorial team assigned to specific historical fields, who work directly in finding reviewers and soliciting reviewees. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What they're running up against is tracking all these people. They currently are using Google Spreadsheets to track who has been contacted, who needs contacting, if someone's been contacted and declined review, if someone's been contacted and wants to be reviewed but needs a follow-up, tracking the state of review drafts, and so on. But it's starting to be a pinch point (part of the problem is different field editors can potentially contact the same reviewee or reviewer -- they want something more unified that anyone can query and track statuses). Short of building their own database system to track everyone, are there other solutions that already exist in managing people and content for journals? I've looked at system like Annotum and Edit Flow, but I don't think they're quite what they need. It doesn't need to be built on top of WordPress, either. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any thoughts? Would Drupal serve as a better alternative? Should we build something from the ground-up?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;[St√©fan Sinclair (via DH Commons mentorship program) suggested that I post here.  I have described this project in my &#34;collaborator&#34; or user profile on DH Commons at &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dhcommons.org&#60;/a&#62; ; direct link from the &#34;Collaborators&#34; section at &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org/users/susan-hollis-merritt&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dhcommons.org/users/susan-hollis-merritt&#60;/a&#62; and in my member profile on MLA Commons at &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.mla.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://commons.mla.org&#60;/a&#62; ; direct member link at &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.mla.org/members/shmerritt/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://commons.mla.org/members/shmerritt/&#60;/a&#62;; direct links are also provided in the Pinter Bibliography and CV sections on my website at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.susanhollismerritt.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.susanhollismerritt.org&#60;/a&#62; , where there are related details.]&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am requesting advice and guidance as I explore the possibility of building a searchable digital database for my &#34;Harold Pinter Bibliography&#34; published in print in volumes of &#60;em&#62;The Pinter Review&#60;/em&#62; (Tampa: The University of Tampa Press, 1987-2011).  Each annual/biennial/special edition of this bibliography is published in MLA format (whatever the most current MLA format has been at the time).  I would plan to continue with MLA format for consistency of documentation style throughout.  (I understand that users of such a bibliography could convert easily to whatever format is desired on their end later.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have word-processed files (WordPerfect) for all of the 14 editions of this bibliography.  The same typist working for The University of Tampa Press prepared my word-processed files into a format to be used by the printer.  For several years, she converted my &#34;Harold Pinter Bibliography&#34; files initially to MS Word document files or various versions of PDF files for the printer.  More recently, I gave her my own PDF file versions of my WordPerfect files, which I believe she also converted to Word or to another format for the printer.  The typist's and printer's digital files may be accessible if I need to have them for easier digital conversion.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A problem with the typist's conversions from one word-processing software program to another has been the loss of accents, punctuation, and other typesetting features, which at times have had to be corrected in printer's proofs.  I have maintained hard copies (original books and parts of books, offprints, photocopies, or print outs) and handwritten index cards (for every entry) to check as back ups of the bibliographic entries in the printed bibliographies for purposes of such error-correction of occasional printer's errors that were missed even in corrected proof.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;From looking into this matter over a decade ago (when ProCite was initially popular), I believe that the printed information (even though digitized) would need to be converted into records featuring bibliographic fields (including annotations, sometimes lengthy, most often very brief) for each printed entry, and each entry would need to have key words and/or phrases (e.g., to accommodate multiple authors, editors, titles, subjects, etc.) so that it could be capable of classification by key words for searching by users.  Also, there are categories and subsections of categories in each published edition of this bibliography that may need some kind of &#34;field&#34;/key word/phrase identification for sorting electronically.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am not familiar with mark up language beyond HTML, but it is possible that I might be able to learn about additional mark up languages if needed (e.g., RIS Format, SML format, etc.).  When I asked this question of a presenter after a DH session at the MLA Convention in Boston, she advised me to look at Drupal (which I have done somewhat), but I am not trained in using it for anything.  It appears to me to be involved in the stage of actually putting an already developed database online.  Another piece of advice I have received is possibly to create an EXCEL type spreadsheet which could be searched.  But before I would begin doing any of this work, I would like to have a plan to use one mode of conversion (one kind of software, so as to avoid duplication of effort).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thus, a main question that I am asking is: What would be the most effective current software package or packages to use for this entire process?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Prior to deciding this project's feasibility and how and where this database would be hosted (institutional partners/support), I need to explore such matters as: (1) the technical requirements for such conversion from printed material to searchable digital format; (2) the estimated cost of such conversion (including the costs of any commercial software packages involved (if any) and of assistance with the physical input of the records); (3) whether or not applying for grant support is warranted; and so on.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I welcome suggestions, advice, and guidance.  Thank you very much.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[(updated on January 17, 2013)Since first posting this, I have been exploring some earlier DH Q&#38;amp;A threads and found Bethany Nowviskie's suggesting that updates are in progress for &#60;a href=&#34;http://arts-humanities.net/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://arts-humanities.net/&#60;/a&#62;, and I will be exploring the &#34;tools&#34; forum there; the &#34;bibliography&#34; section returned an error message when I tried it, so I'll try it again later.]&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We are at the very start of a project which will populate a relational database with information from archives across the world. There will be three people working on the database and ultimately we want it to be openly available and searchable as an online research tool. Would Microsoft access on sharepoint be a good way of facilitating the collaborative research?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have to apologize in advance for any infelicities of expression in this post - I'm very new to DH and don't know all of the lingo. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm working on my dissertation in an American Studies department, and I'm writing a chapter about non-fiction science books produced for kids in the US during the 1920s and 1930s. In the process of researching, I've come across many book lists (issued by librarians and children's book reviewers) and have started to compile a big Zotero folder full of examples of relevant titles. It's starting to become clear that part of the work that this chapter will have to do is to show large-scale shifts in this field over time. I'm beginning to think that I might try to build a bibliography...or a database?...that could inform the chapter's argument, and could be available to readers, as well. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What I'd really like to do is to have a way to enter all of these book titles into some kind of program that would then allow me to show the way that this field of publication evolved over time. Ideally I'd love to be able to enter each book into this program, assigning it metadata, including subject matter, publishing house, author, date of pub, types of illustrations, appearance on these &#34;best-of&#34; lists, and possibly some fields that I haven't anticipated as of yet. Then I'd like to be able to produce visualizations (graphs? timelines?) of the way that each of these fields change over time. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd also love for the final product (database? bibliography?) to be presentable via a website, and publicly searchable/visible. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any advice you could give would be most welcome. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Rebecca

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am looking for tools that universities use to allow faculty to submit their annual activity reports online that would then allow the different offices to pull and compiles relevant information. The office of serving learning could then gather all the data related to service learning and civic engagement in the reports. I was thinking about it in terms of my department chair and dean putting together their annual reports. Today, I talked with our computing services and it turns out our research office wants something similar that would allow them to pull out a report on a keyword search -- such as what's going on in digital humanities at Wright State?  It would be great if faculty to could login and add to the report under the different headings throughout the year and then click submit when they want to share it or turn it in. It would help, of course, if it would format all the publications, grants, etc. for us as well. Is there something open source that does this now? Right now, we each submit the report as a word file.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
