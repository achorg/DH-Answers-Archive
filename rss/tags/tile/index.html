			<description>&#60;p&#62;Take a look at Hyperimage - I think this is closer to what you had in mind: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.uni-lueneburg.de/hyperimage/hyperimage/idee_E.htm&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.uni-lueneburg.de/hyperimage/hyperimage/idee_E.htm&#60;/a&#62; The resource is well supported with an active community of users and developers.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for your proposals. TILE sounds good but isn't exactly what I'm looking for. My question goes beyond an image mapping tool to such degree as I don't want to link some images with some texts but a whole datebase, so that you can find relations between all the images. For example: &#34;X&#34; is mapped on one image, if you click on &#34;X&#34; you'll see some text which describes it and lists all other images where also parts which are similiar to &#34;X&#34; (for example a special type of an iconographic motif) are mapped. Or does any project exist where text-image-linking in a big dimension has already been realised?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you're looking for something more lightweight than TILE, it sounds like maybe you're talking about an &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_map.asp&#34;&#62;image map&#60;/a&#62;. You can generate the code for an image map with an &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.image-maps.com/&#34;&#62;online tool&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What do you need beyond what an &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_map.asp&#34;&#62;ordinary HTML imagemap&#60;/a&#62; would give you? It'll be easier to find you appropriate solutions if we understand that.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Part of what you're thinking about (connecting images to text) is what &#60;a href=&#34;http://mith.umd.edu/tile/&#34;&#62;TILE&#60;/a&#62; is designed to do.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for a tool which connects parts of images with text, maybe with an encyclopedia. For example: You have an image which shows some things: x, y, z. Now I want to know more about x. Does anybody know an application/tool where I can click on x and receive more information about x?
