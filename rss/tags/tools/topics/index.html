			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working on a Digital Humanities Best Practices document that would serve as a list of questions humanities scholars could ask themselves as they get started on a collaborative project--something that is widely applicable, accessible, and quick and easy to read (meaning: not written in prose, not one person's reflections about their DH experience, not behind a paywall). The scope is specifically geared toward setting expectations and the issues to consider including in a charter / contract.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It currently exists as an editable document on Google Drive -- and I'd love feedback!! What's missing, what's too broad/specific? Other great links to share? I'd especially like thoughts on integrating language re: open source, creative commons, code.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's the link:&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi all, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am currently working on an NLP project using Old English (OE) as the target language. I was wondering, what digital resources and tools are currently available. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In terms of corpora and lexicographic resources, I am working with the&#60;br /&#62;
- Old English Dictionary (OED) and the associated corpus and&#60;br /&#62;
- York-Toronto-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English Prose (YCOE)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In terms of tools, I haven't found much specifically geared towards OE other than the corpus reader that comes with NLTK.&#60;br /&#62;
Is there anything out there in terms of tools, e.g. POS taggers?&#60;br /&#62;
I am grateful for any hints. Thanks a lot. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Kind regards, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Martin
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-might-dh-take-advantage-of-heads-up-displays-ie-google-glass#post-1966</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Greetings all,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've been chosen to participate in Google's beta rollout of their heads up display product Google Glass, and am curious to hear some interesting ideas as to how such technologies might be leveraged to do interesting things in the Digital Humanities (or, in fact, in the Humanities in general). I do have some ideas for what sorts of things might be useful to start building (as does my institution, where foreign language learning is a major educational focus), but I'd be remiss if I didn't pick the brains of people far more creative than me.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) What kinds of apps might a heads up display be best suited for when it comes to education in the Humanities (especially literature, history, and culture)?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2) What kinds of research questions might such a device be able to raise?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;3) The technology behind Google Glass is what they call a Mirror API -- it is based on working with open data APIs and server-side apps that sync with Google's services to send data back and forth to the hardware. For example, one app that's already developed is from the New York Times, that sends various news alerts to glass wearers subscribing to their feeds. Things like weather, anything from social media, etc. are obvious apps that will undoubtedly appear quite quickly, but I'm interested in what kinds of open APIs exist out in the DH world (for raw data, data analysis, etc.) that might be a good fit for the types of interactions that Google Glass offers? What types of data out in the DH world might be in need of building and prepping to make them available to apps like Glass might be fit for?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, if anyone is interested (especially those that tend more towards the programming/tools development arena of DH) in being part of some DH projects that use Google Glass, please feel free to contact me off-list.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Many, many thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for a server-side tool I can use to compare some images. I'm familiar with the Virtual Lightbox at MITH (&#60;a href=&#34;http://mith.umd.edu/lightbox/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mith.umd.edu/lightbox/)&#60;/a&#62;, but according to the site it hasn't been touched since 2004 and I'm wondering if there is anything newer that does the same kind of thing.

						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/seeking-a-generalizable-metadata-mapping-tool#post-1916</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for what is probably the holy grail of metadata: a generalizable mapping tool. I could specify the final output (in XML), perhaps based on a schema or I could just indicate somehow the output tags and attributes. This tool would enable a user to put in their metadata in whatever format it's in (any XML, csv, excel), map fields/tags/attributes from their metadata document into the tags and attributes I've specified, and would spit out a document that follows my format.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;An example of how this would function is the Sheet Music Consortium Metadata Mapping Tool, which is unfortunately not generalizable and doesn't accept XML (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/smcmigrator/upload.php&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/smcmigrator/upload.php&#60;/a&#62;)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does such a thing exist?

				<title>olaf on "How create a real (with page numbers) index of journal&#039;s entire run, from PDFs?"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-create-a-real-with-page-numbers-index-of-journals-entire-run-from-pdfs#post-1904</link>
			<pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2013 17:57:10 +0000</pubDate>
			<dc:creator>olaf</dc:creator>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">1904@http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/</guid>
			<description>&#60;p&#62;I need to index all back issues of &#60;em&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://mamluk.uchicago.edu&#34;&#62;Mamluk Studies Review&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/em&#62; (open access, now digital only but formerly print) but have not had much luck finding ideas about how to go about it.&#60;br /&#62;
Searching the Web for info about indexing PDFs leads largely to results about indexing them on a computer for improved searches, or to indexing services.&#60;br /&#62;
I hope to find software (or scripts or something!) that can &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;read PDF files&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;understand the idea of page numbers&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;understand that each page in a pdf is a distinct entity&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;handle Unicode and diacritics (and, ideally, Arabic script)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;see phrases or hyphenated words that break across pages as single items&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't expect anything to happen automatically: I know I (or better yet an unwary grad student) will have to actually go through and mark words and phrases to be included in the index.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Bonus points if it can be taught to ignore certain strings when alphabetizing. For example, since 'al-' is Arabic for 'the', it doesn't affect alphabetization (so al-Nasir Muhammad goes in the N section).&#60;br /&#62;
Similarly, there needs to be a way to instruct it that ā and a are the same for purposes of alphabetization, as are ṣ and s, etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Super bonus points if it can recognize (or learn to recognize) variations on a word or phrase in terms of spelling (often inconsistent when transliteration is involved), word order or intervening words.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What I have: 23 issues of the journal as whole-book pdfs, as well as individual pdfs of all articles. Unfortunately, the first half dozen or so were created without Unicode, using proprietary fonts with non-standard encodings. Messy, but I can work around it somehow. I also have InDesign files (various versions) for about half the issues. This will all be done in Windows (32-bit XP and 64-bit 7). I always have the latest version of Acrobat (not reader, the full program).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The resulting index will be posted on the Web, probably both as a PDF and in some more dynamic and usable format(s). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any ideas for ways to streamline this would be appreciated. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Olaf

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm starting some contract work on a small, new website for a grant-funded curricular program. Between now and when the site launches, I need to communicate with a small group of non-technical faculty stakeholders/collaborators about all the usual components of a new site: wireframe prototypes, sample graphic designs, current status of work, bugs/enhancement requests, and such. For reasons related to travel and scheduling, it'll be difficult to get everyone in the same physical space before the site launches, and I need some good tools to streamline that communication.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For these faculty, the default communication method would usually be email, but that quickly becomes unwieldy for &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&#34;&#62;agile development approaches&#60;/a&#62;. For some of what I need, I could cobble something together from Google tools, but I'm not ready to teach humanities faculty how to file bugs/enhancements into a &#60;a href=&#34;http://trac.edgewall.org/&#34;&#62;Trac&#60;/a&#62; system.  I'm looking for something a little cleaner and smoother. I don't have a private server, so I'll need either a hosted service or something that can run happily on a shared webhost. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My software-developer friends in industry tell me that &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/overview&#34;&#62;Atlassian Confluence&#60;/a&#62; is a really good option for what I need. At $10/month for the hosted version with 10 users, it's cheap, but I'm reluctant to deploy something that'll be an ongoing budget expense unless it really is better than other options (i.e. less work for me). What other tools should I be considering?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A colleague has asked me about Collective Access (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.collectiveaccess.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.collectiveaccess.org/&#60;/a&#62;) and I've not heard of it until now. Does anyone here have experience with it? I've looked at a couple of the featured projects and it looks similar to Omeka (it's a digital object content management system plus front-end for searching and display). I'm going to install it and play around to see what it can do and how it's different from Omeka, but I'd appreciate any insight or feedback from people who have used it. Thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working with a partner on an update to the TEIDisplay plugin for Omeka and looking for user input. Do you use TEIDisplay or another tool for displaying TEI Documents? Why did you choose that tool and how does it meet/not meet your needs? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Additionally, what type of documents would you expect to display (e.g., poetry, correspondence, etc.) in a generalizable interface? For a general audience, what should a template for displaying these texts in an Omeka exhibit include? For instance, which teiHeader elements are most important (e.g., file description, revision history)? Would you want to display bibliographic codes and numbers such as page breaks and numbers or paragraph numbers? We assume folks would want to see additions and deletions and notes, but what other aspects of your texts should be displayed for a general audience? What would you add to this list for a general audience?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(More context for this project is available here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.scholarslab.org/announcements/collaborative-mentoring-at-ut-and-uva-co-developing-an-updated-teidisplay-for-omeka/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.scholarslab.org/announcements/collaborative-mentoring-at-ut-and-uva-co-developing-an-updated-teidisplay-for-omeka/&#60;/a&#62; and here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.scholarslab.org/digital-humanities/an-update-to-teidisplay-for-omeka/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.scholarslab.org/digital-humanities/an-update-to-teidisplay-for-omeka/&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm making a tech request to upgrade/renovate/build a tech lab for the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative here at MSU (chi.matrix.msu.edu).  I've got some general ideas as to what is going to be in the request.  However, I thought I would throw the question out to the community and see if people had suggestions for purchases - stuff that I may not have thought about.  These could include software, hardware, peripherals, online services &#38;amp; sites, etc.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This lab would mostly be used for cultural heritage informatics projects - anthropology, archaeology, history, classics, art history, museology, historic geography, etc.  (though, that hardly is a good representation of the kinds of things that it might end up being used for).  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, what would you request?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for a fairly user-friendly open source protocol for developing a web-based project that basically combines organized, user-contributed links (kind of like an online bibliography) with tagging capabilities and discussion boards. It would be great if I could develop something easy for users to navigate, as the site would be geared toward college-level writing students and instructors.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Right now I'm looking at Drupal and BuddyPress, and I'm also thinking to use APIs, possibly from delicious, Mendeley, and I'm interested in looking into OpenCalais for pulling metadata from the linked sources. But, I'm really new to all of this and I'm wondering if anyone else has any other suggestions of tools that I might look into using--?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I work in contemporary literature, so almost everything I study is under copyright. Many things I study are available in attenuated digital formats like google books, or kindle editions, but those sorts of formats are not available for doing even a simple text manipulation or visualization, like, say slamming it into Wordle. Other that pushing for available full-access digital editions, what tools are there out there for those times when you find yourself confronted with something that is irredeemably paper?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been using ArcGIS for a project, but am interesting in running some open-source alternative. I use a Mac, but am interested in recommendations for open-source GIS software for any platform? Anyone have suggestions?
