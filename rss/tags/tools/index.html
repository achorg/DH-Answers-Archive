			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working on a Digital Humanities Best Practices document that would serve as a list of questions humanities scholars could ask themselves as they get started on a collaborative project--something that is widely applicable, accessible, and quick and easy to read (meaning: not written in prose, not one person's reflections about their DH experience, not behind a paywall). The scope is specifically geared toward setting expectations and the issues to consider including in a charter / contract.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It currently exists as an editable document on Google Drive -- and I'd love feedback!! What's missing, what's too broad/specific? Other great links to share? I'd especially like thoughts on integrating language re: open source, creative commons, code.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's the link:&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi all, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am currently working on an NLP project using Old English (OE) as the target language. I was wondering, what digital resources and tools are currently available. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In terms of corpora and lexicographic resources, I am working with the&#60;br /&#62;
- Old English Dictionary (OED) and the associated corpus and&#60;br /&#62;
- York-Toronto-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English Prose (YCOE)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In terms of tools, I haven't found much specifically geared towards OE other than the corpus reader that comes with NLTK.&#60;br /&#62;
Is there anything out there in terms of tools, e.g. POS taggers?&#60;br /&#62;
I am grateful for any hints. Thanks a lot. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Kind regards, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Martin
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Seems to me Google Glass Apps will build upon the &#34;Augmented Reality&#34; tools that people have been tinkering with on smart phones for a few years now.  This is often used to augment trips to cities or museums.  Here's an iPhone app for historical Edinburgh and a list to virtual cities projects collected by a UNC class.&#60;br /&#62;
I'm going to a wedding in Scotland this month, will have to try it out and report!&#60;br /&#62;

&#34;A JISC funded iPhone App that lets visitors to Edinburgh walk over historical maps. The maps are provided by Landmark Information Group and the National Library of Scotland. The software was developed by Edinburgh College of Art, University of Edinburgh. Historical tours were provided with the kind assistance of Edinburgh World Heritage and Margaret Stewart.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Virtual Cities projects - &#60;a href=&#34;http://virtualcities.web.unc.edu/projects/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://virtualcities.web.unc.edu/projects/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
&#34;The following list is a working list of “Virtual Cities” projects. This projects and sites on this list range from extensive academic and library projects to one-off journalistic data visualization. The list is long but far from exhaustive–so please feel free to comment with additional sites!&#34;

&#60;p&#62;If you don't have a lot of support for code modding, should I presume you don't have much infrastructural support as well? This stuff necessitates installing FastCGI on a server, as well as IIPImage Server (&#60;a href=&#34;http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/)&#60;/a&#62;. It can be installed whole hog on a recent-version Ubuntu server relatively easily, but that last phrase's meaning may vary greatly.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If your holdup is in code modding and not infrastructure, I might be able to help with some light modding, as I've done some for my own needs already. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(Belated note that I corresponded about this way back with Joe Padfield at the National Gallery, and he was wonderful to work with.)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for something simple. The VL is set up to automatically load with specified images already there, then you can move them around, zoom in and out, nice for basic comparison. I don't have much support for code modification right now. I'll check out IIPImage!

&#60;p&#62;What sort of comparisons are you looking to do? And who do you have available for what level of creation or adaptation?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've had some luck with using adaptations of the National Gallery (UK) adaptations of IIPImage, such as &#60;a href=&#34;http://cima.ng-london.org.uk/iip/examples/newcomp.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://cima.ng-london.org.uk/iip/examples/newcomp.html&#60;/a&#62;. Further examples of what they've done are at &#60;a href=&#34;http://research.ng-london.org.uk/wiki/index.php/National_Gallery_IIPImage&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://research.ng-london.org.uk/wiki/index.php/National_Gallery_IIPImage&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for a server-side tool I can use to compare some images. I'm familiar with the Virtual Lightbox at MITH (&#60;a href=&#34;http://mith.umd.edu/lightbox/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mith.umd.edu/lightbox/)&#60;/a&#62;, but according to the site it hasn't been touched since 2004 and I'm wondering if there is anything newer that does the same kind of thing.

&#60;p&#62;Turns out the Curator's Workbench actually can output in other formats - you can give it an XSD and then map your input data to that. Sorry I was confused at first!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Greetings all,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've been chosen to participate in Google's beta rollout of their heads up display product Google Glass, and am curious to hear some interesting ideas as to how such technologies might be leveraged to do interesting things in the Digital Humanities (or, in fact, in the Humanities in general). I do have some ideas for what sorts of things might be useful to start building (as does my institution, where foreign language learning is a major educational focus), but I'd be remiss if I didn't pick the brains of people far more creative than me.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) What kinds of apps might a heads up display be best suited for when it comes to education in the Humanities (especially literature, history, and culture)?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2) What kinds of research questions might such a device be able to raise?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;3) The technology behind Google Glass is what they call a Mirror API -- it is based on working with open data APIs and server-side apps that sync with Google's services to send data back and forth to the hardware. For example, one app that's already developed is from the New York Times, that sends various news alerts to glass wearers subscribing to their feeds. Things like weather, anything from social media, etc. are obvious apps that will undoubtedly appear quite quickly, but I'm interested in what kinds of open APIs exist out in the DH world (for raw data, data analysis, etc.) that might be a good fit for the types of interactions that Google Glass offers? What types of data out in the DH world might be in need of building and prepping to make them available to apps like Glass might be fit for?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, if anyone is interested (especially those that tend more towards the programming/tools development arena of DH) in being part of some DH projects that use Google Glass, please feel free to contact me off-list.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Many, many thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Unfortunately, the Curator's Workbench that Kevin mentions only produces MODS; the output format is not configurable.

&#60;p&#62;Excel's XML mapping is actually pretty powerful. Here's some official documentation:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/map-and-unmap-xml-elements-HP010206397.aspx&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/map-and-unmap-xml-elements-HP010206397.aspx&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It's *very* confusing to use, though. Basically the procedure is:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) get some data in Excel&#60;br /&#62;
2) give Excel a sample file with the structure you want, or an XML schema file&#60;br /&#62;
3) Tell Excel which column goes in which XML element&#60;br /&#62;
4) export your data as XML&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are definitely some limitations, and I have to re-learn how to use it every time I need it, but when I do that I'm always surprised at the amount of functionality there.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for what is probably the holy grail of metadata: a generalizable mapping tool. I could specify the final output (in XML), perhaps based on a schema or I could just indicate somehow the output tags and attributes. This tool would enable a user to put in their metadata in whatever format it's in (any XML, csv, excel), map fields/tags/attributes from their metadata document into the tags and attributes I've specified, and would spit out a document that follows my format.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;An example of how this would function is the Sheet Music Consortium Metadata Mapping Tool, which is unfortunately not generalizable and doesn't accept XML (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/smcmigrator/upload.php&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/smcmigrator/upload.php&#60;/a&#62;)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does such a thing exist?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You could try indexing software such as &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.pdfindexgenerator.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.pdfindexgenerator.com/&#60;/a&#62;. But it sounds as if the level of quality and detail to which you aspire would be best handled not so much by software but by hiring a professional indexer who already uses such software and can write a strong index in a timely manner. Of course, if you have more time than money, this may not be feasible.
