			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm trying to help a scholar who'd like to create a website that can do two things:&#60;br /&#62;
1) Display a digitized songbook; and&#60;br /&#62;
2) Allow the user to see differences among multiple editions of this songbook.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As one might imagine, this songbook includes both musical notation and text. Currently, the images are (I believe) PDFs.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm thinking this sounds Juxta-ish, but can Juxta be deployed on the Web? What would you do? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This question has been floating on my mind this week during conversations about the future of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.juxtasoftware.org/&#34;&#62;Juxta&#60;/a&#62;. The traditional &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff&#34;&#62;diff&#60;/a&#62; algorithm would look at strings of text linearly. So if you have two series, A) a b c d f g h j q z, and B) a b c d e f g i j k r x y z, the diff algorithm recognizes that they share C) a b c d f g j z. In a series of versions of a given text, where an author and his collaborators have moved/transposed several blocks of text from one version to the next, the diff algorithm fails to recognize these moves, even though internal to those blocks the diff still applies. So the question is: Given a series X) a b c [d f g h j] q ... n, and a series Y) a [d f i h j] b c q ... n, how can we get the computer to recognize that Z) [d f h j] corresponds to each other and has moved? If I could solve this puzzle, we could teach Juxta to recognize moves automatically, or at least, suggest possible matches to make the scholar's work easier... I think. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One of the problems is that I don't know what kind of problem this is in terms of computer science or math: Is it a &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching&#34;&#62;Matching&#60;/a&#62; problem? A &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_matching&#34;&#62;String searching algorithm&#60;/a&#62; problem? I'm randomly walking in the Math and Computer Science department next week, but I figure I'd run it by the DH community just in case.

				<title>Carin Ruff on "Organizing the work of transcription for a critical edition"</title>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm (seemingly perpetually) in the early stages of a critical edition of a Latin text and am looking for advice on the best tools to organize the work of transcription. There's only one of me, so I don't need something specifically geared towards crowd-sourcing. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some particulars:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;– I have about 20 full or partial manuscripts of a text of approximately 17,000 words.&#60;br /&#62;
– I don't especially want to fully automate the collation process once I've transcribed all the mss, but I WOULD like to be able to quickly pull the transcriptions of a particular passage for two or more mss, or query my transcriptions for particular lemmata to look for agreement or disagreement. I'd love something that makes &#34;manual&#34; collation very accessible visually - that is, something that will produce literally a synopsis of readings.&#60;br /&#62;
– If there's a tool that would easily accommodate making discursive notes to myself as I transcribe, that would be fab.&#60;br /&#62;
– I expect this project to have at least two distinct end-products, one a traditional (i.e, paper) critical edition, and one an electronic, single-manuscript edition from the earliest witness. My main concern at the transcription phase is not to do anything that would close off the possibility of either kind of output.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So I guess I really have two questions:&#60;br /&#62;
1) Is there software that will help with logistical and visual organization, and...&#60;br /&#62;
2) To what extent should I be thinking about coding at the transcription stage? That is, presumably I'd need to add some very basic coding to make the text query-able in the way I'm envisioning, but there are lots of features of the text that won't be meaningfully encodable until I've established the text...and here I get lost in a hermeneutic circle.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any suggestions for tools and/or help thinking through this would be gratefully received.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Carin

				<title>Daniel Allington on "Web application for visualisation of variance across multiple witnesses?"</title>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I’d just like to ask the community for advice on a possible project I’ve been discussing with a colleague who works in information technology. The idea began with a little scholarly dream I have had for a while, which is of an interactive website that visualises the variance between all the texts of a particular work and enables the user to navigate through that variance intuitively, encountering (and perhaps adding) notes on the way and (if necessary) reporting errors. Rather than construct a one-off website, I think it could be more productive to create an open source web application that could be used in the production of websites based around other works: you’d upload digital versions of the texts (and if possible, scans of the originals), and the application (suitably customised) would form the user interface. The website could then be made public in stages, eg. first to a group of editors, then to a community of peer reviewers, and finally to everyone. This also opens the possibility of using the application as a communal transcription tool. As I see it, however, the central challenge will be to find creative ways of visualising variance: I’ve seen various ways of visualising the variance between pairs of witnesses, for example, but the question of how to visualise variance between larger numbers of texts seems to me to be quite open (as does the question of how to make such visualisations comprehensible on the small screen of a smartphone).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;These are very early days yet (no code written, no funding secured), and any advice that can be offered on any aspect of this project would be appreciated. Particularly helpful would be an indication of how useful people think an application like this might be (or of how it could be made more useful): if I’m the only one who thinks it would be interesting to produce editions of the kind and in the way I’ve described, then I had better drop the application idea and try to put together my website by hand!
