			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Dan,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The &#34;freemium&#34; business model, when applied to publishing, often works out the way you describe: a version of the work is freely available to read online, perhaps even under a Creative Commons or other open license, but more convenient versions (like ebooks and print versions) are available for purchase.  Some titles in OpenEdition and OAPEN are available this way, and DOAB points to many others.  We use this model for titles published under the digitalculturebooks imprint: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalculture.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.digitalculture.org/&#60;/a&#62; , and Utah State University Press makes titles available in HathiTrust ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?a=listis;c=869533047&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?a=listis;c=869533047&#60;/a&#62; ), with the full view including a &#34;buy a copy&#34; link.  For others, see:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* &#60;a href=&#34;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Dual-edition_publishing&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Dual-edition_publishing&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
* &#60;a href=&#34;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Tiered_quality&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Tiered_quality&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for open content selling well, some evidence has shown that it has helped sales, while others see no impact on sales.  We at Michigan are unaware of any evidence that it hurts sales; our digitalculturebooks titles are among the University of Michigan Press titles that sell best despite being freely available to read online.  For more, see:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=(&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.google.com/search?q=(&#60;/a&#62;&#34;open+access&#34;+OR+OA)+effect+sales&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In case it helps, here's an example of supplementary material that was never included in the print edition of the book (even as a CD-ROM):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/r/ramsey/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/r/ramsey/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;By the way, if I were Google, I would also accept only paper, PDF/A-1b, or PDF/A-2b as input.  There are fewer variables on input (like page size and the number of colors per page) than if you start accepting people's digital files.  It's kind of like how Google only wants to crawl webpages and PDFs: you can offer them all sorts of structured metadata, but they're just going to use their standard algorithms anyway.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm in discussions with a press about a second edition of a 100k word edition of an Old English poem. I'm pushing for an open, on-line release of the text with Print-on-Demand and ePub sales from the site. Since the introduction is frequently cited, and is available in part on Google Books already (ironically for a print-and-CD-ROM digital edition, Google just scanned the print copy), my argument is the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) People who are really in the market for a 100k word book on a 9-line poem are going to want to buy a copy in a format they can annotate, read off line, and that is generally more pleasing on the eye than a standard web-page (you'd be surprised how many people have wanted a copy in the last 8 years!)&#60;br /&#62;
2) People who are prepared to put up with poorer-quality, long-form presentation because they can get it for free on-line are basically already being lost to the Google Books site&#60;br /&#62;
3) Putting the whole argument and text out on the web will help keep the book central to debates in the field, presumably increasing the number of people buying copies under argument 1 above.&#60;br /&#62;
4) Reprinting a book+CD-ROM digital text today captures the worst of all worlds: we miss the exposure on-line publication provides via search engines and we lock the most flexible format (the digital) in a medium that is increasingly difficult to use and is certainly not multi-platform.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I can think of one somewhat parallel case that seems to show these arguments: Peter Baker's Introduction to Old English which, I am told, has sold very well through the years even though it has always been freely available on-line in a version that, if anything, is actually more feature-rich than the print copy. Does anybody know of any other examples?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some background: the edition was published in 2005 in a Print-and-CD-ROM, where the CD-ROM contained the full text of the print book and additional views, tools, and features. The edition itself has done better than you might think for a pretty long edition of a 9-line poem (I believe it sold through 3+ print runs) and it was runner up for MLA's best edition in 2007 (first medieval edition and I believe first digital to be so recognised). What I want to do now is publish a revised version of the contents of the CD-ROM to the web and offer POD copies and ePubs of the book content for sale from the site. My theory is that they are likely to sell for much the same reason the book sold in the first place: people use digital texts but given the choice they are still happy doing long-form reading in a format that is better suited to it that the browser.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any advice? Parallel examples? Other ideas?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Feel free to contact me out-of-band. dorothea.salo at gmail.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Single-source: the best I know of is the Directory of Open-Access Journals's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.doaj.org/bpguide/&#34;&#62;Best Practices Guide&#60;/a&#62;. If that's not enough...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://repository.alt.ac.uk/887/&#34;&#62;Journal tendering for societies: a brief guide&#60;/a&#62; has useful background information. So does Jan Velterop's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.soros.org/openaccess/scholarly_guide.shtml&#34;&#62;Guide to Open Access Publishing and Scholarly Societies&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On the mechanics of electronic publishing generally, try Sally Morris's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.inasp.info/file/179/getting-started-in-electronic-publishing.html&#34;&#62;Getting Started in Electronic Journal Publishing&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With regard to software, the open-source choice is currently &#60;a href=&#34;http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs&#34;&#62;Open Journal Systems&#60;/a&#62;. Before you decide to download and install it, CHECK WITH YOUR LIBRARY (and have your fellows at other institutions do likewise). Chances aren't bad that one of your libraries either runs an OJS installation or has purchased the BePress suite of institutional-repository services, which includes a journal-publishing platform.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hope this helps!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, take a look this guide: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.doaj.org/bpguide/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.doaj.org/bpguide/&#60;/a&#62; It covers most of the bases. As a platform, I recommend OJS (&#60;a href=&#34;http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs)&#60;/a&#62;. It's fairly deep but there are ways to bypass some of its features if you don't need a full, multi-stage review and edit process. I've also found the people on the OJS forums to be helpful and accessible.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Following that you may find this guide on possible income models for open access journals to be useful as well: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arl.org/sparc/publisher/incomemodels/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.arl.org/sparc/publisher/incomemodels/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're thinking about starting an open access interdisciplinary digital journal on the &#34;Comparative Wests.&#34; We don't want to reinvent the wheel. Where should we look for examples, advice, platforms we can adopt, or collaborations we might join if we go down this road. Thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Nice one Dorothea!  Even though I was trying to put the brakes on, I'm so much a first son that I have my own ideologies about formats, and those probably shine through quite clearly :-).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Trying for a better approach: it seems to me that most of the DH-related data curation I've been involved with has revolved around migration/rescue.  That is, the conversion from either an obsolete format (e.g. SGML) to a modern one (e.g. XML), or from one type of encoding to another (ISO 8859-1 to UTF-8), or extracting data from some system (perhaps a desktop db like Filemaker or Access) for insertion into another (say MySQL).  That seems like a core task that isn't going away.  It's made difficult when I have to ask questions or make assumptions about the intentions of the data's creators: &#34;What does this mean?&#34;; &#34;How are these things related&#34;; &#34;What's missing?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It's harder still when there's nobody to ask those questions of, or when there are layers of different decisions by different people in the data.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I think documentation and metadata are things that can help mitigate the pain of those who will have to deal with your data in its afterlife.  Open formats and the use of open source are good in this context because they are more likely to be available and usable (or able to be modified so that they can be used, or at the very least able to be read so they can be re-created).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Update/postscript: put another way, participants in DH projects should imagine they are in a conversation with future scholars, and should explain not just what was done, but why and how.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've put in my two cents at Book of Trogool: &#60;a href=&#34;http://scientopia.org/blogs/bookoftrogool/2010/12/07/the-four-sons-of-digital-curation/&#34;&#62;the Four Sons of digital curation&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;First (though I'm sure you've looked at it already) this thread: &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-does-it-mean-to-future-proof-a-dh-project&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-does-it-mean-to-future-proof-a-dh-project&#60;/a&#62; has some good stuff in it (even my comment).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Second: the anti/pro embedded markup (read TEI) stuff is a rat-hole.*  Avoid it.  Open, well-documented (and ideally common) formats are the answer.  Any old format can be rescued/reverse-engineered if it was well-documented. I've converted enough SGML (even GML!) to know it isn't a problem.  A corollary to this is that if you're using a homebrewed data format, your documentation burden must be correspondingly higher.  TEI is almost certainly better than any XML format I might invent for this reason.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;TEI-ish XML is good in some ways, because editorial decisions/practices can be documented and bundled in the same file as the text.  But there's absolutely nothing wrong with plain text.  Pick the best tool for your task and move on.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The data curation task is enabled by careful thought and planning around data format decisions, good documentation of the practices used in creating the data and the recording of information about its state and how it got there.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;*A rabbit hole is a distracting tangent to the discussion that might have something good as an outcome.  A rat hole does not have that attraction.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Yes it is possible but &#60;em&#62;not&#60;/em&#62; trivial to remove embedded markup from archived documents: 1) white space between elements is regarded as markup. So dividing text with tags creates an ambiguity: does the markup white space equal white space in the text or not? i.e. are part-words divided by tags to be conjoined or not? 2) alternatives such as addition, deletion, sic and corr, variants etc when the markup is removed produces nonsense. To correct this you need to write a program and to have a parser handy. Show me a complete and working SGML parser for 12 year old texts. 3) markup added to overcome its deficiencies such as virtual joins can't just be removed without loss of important information. I never asked for it to be mandated not to use it, only that its use not be mandated.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In response to the above, I'd like also to propose that you not ask them to &#60;em&#62;exclude&#60;/em&#62; embedded markup. It is doubtless useful to be able to access Unicode text versions of document data, but this is trivial to retrieve from any markup system; in the case of most marked-up documents, the bulk of the actual value of the document (in terms of scholarly work invested in creating the transcription) inheres in the markup itself. I think it is good practice to provide easy access to Unicode text versions of marked-up texts as part of an application that hosts and delivers them, and if the application itself is being curated, then this functionality needs to be supported by the curation system.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Please do not ask them to mandate the use of any form of embedded markup for data curation. What should be archived for others to freely repurpose and reuse is not text embedded with the subjective judgements of individuals, or the programming instructions of today that will mean nothing tomorrow. The only mandate for format (if any) should be plain Unicode text.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In December 2010, the Outreach Committee of the ACH (Association for Computers and the Humanities) will draft open letters to the funders of digital humanities projects, advocating for the establishment of data curation or management plans and open source / open access guidelines for grant-funded DH.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We will share drafts of the letters for public comment before circulating them to funders.  In the meantime, we're hoping you'll help inform the process by sharing your ideas and examples below -- positive or negative -- of the relationship of digital humanities projects to open source, open access, and data curation or management. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We've also set up a Google Doc which can be edited anonymously: &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/i6DNw&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/i6DNw&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What should we be sure to address in these letters?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Many thanks on behalf of the ACH Outreach Committee,&#60;br /&#62;
