				<title>gscottrobinson on "Reasonable goals for a first DH project?"</title>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm interested in learning more about computer-based textual analysis, so I developed a project using the journal Literature/Film Quarterly (LFQ). I haven't done this sort of research before, so I'm trying to determine the best questions to ask and the tools that will help me answer them. I'm hoping someone might be able to tell me if these are reasonable questions to ask. I'd also appreciate any suggestions. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;LFQ began in 1973 and continues now. As the oldest journal in the field, looking at the text should be able to provide some insights about how adaptation studies developed.  At about 50 articles a year for 43 years, I'm looking at 2150 articles.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Questions: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Can an examination of the entire text of LFQ reveal anything substantial about the way adaptation studies has changed from 1973-present?&#60;br /&#62;
What are the most frequently cited texts in each year? WebofScience doesn't support this journal.&#60;br /&#62;
What names (other scholars) appear most frequently each year?&#60;br /&#62;
What kinds of terms are used in earlier years (e.g. “fidelity,” &#34;intertextuality&#34;) and do they continue throughout the journal’s history?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If there are other questions that I could explore, I'd appreciate any suggestions.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm curious to know what software humanities scholars are using to wrangle large collections of images. I often encounter scholars who struggle to manage large image collections — it's not at all unusual to find people managing collections of historical images with iPhoto — and wondered if there are databases that make sense for visual collections. I'm especially interested in programs that:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;work out of the box and have a GUI (sorry)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;are designed for individuals, not enterprises&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;allow a scholar to quickly apprehend many images at once&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;allow one to add metadata (like place and date) — something beyond tags would be nice — and construct queries&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;make sense for people who have a lot of digital surrogates of primary sources (which is to say, systems that are optimized to retrieve the EXIF data from a photo of an archival document won't make a whole lot of sense)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know about Picasa, LightRoom, and ImagePlot. I don't think an enterprise-level system like ContenDM or the like makes sense for individual scholars. Omeka, of course, is nice, but it's a bit unwieldy if you're just trying to manage a collection. What am I missing?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have a beginners question re TEI 5 and would be grateful for any suggestions re same.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;How does one begin to encode metdata? ie: I have a transcription and am doing a very light encoding thereof - just &#38;lt;head&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/head&#38;gt;, &#38;lt;person&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/person&#38;gt;, &#38;lt;place&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/place&#38;gt; (which hopefully are correct!). If I have footnotes re certain parts of the main body of text, how to encode it and where to I place it in the TEI that I am writing in Oxygen Editor (ie: How do I show what the info refers to? Do I keep the footnote system?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;D'autres fils de discussion ont abordé la question de lectures de base pour les &#60;em&#62;digital humanities&#60;/em&#62; (ou informatique en sciences humaines), comme celui sur &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/digital-humanities-reading-list-for-phd-prelim-exams&#34;&#62;les examens généraux pour les doctorants&#60;/a&#62;, mais ils se limitent surtout à l'anglais. Quelles seraient les lectures de base en français pour les &#34;digital humanities&#34;?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For many non-tt faculty, there are few, if any, resources available to them in order to work on developing the skills to (technical or otherwise) to &#34;do&#34; DH. Would it be possible to build off of the DHSI bootcamp model of one week and expand it to opportunities for non-tt academics to collaborate on-site at a DH center/project to be able to really work in DH and learn the tools? I'm really thinking of the opportunity to see what you can do with DH, as well as take the time to learn and immerse themselves in that environemtn.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd like to map and track ideas that were debated in several little magazines of the 1920s to present a visualisation of where those &#34;conversations&#34; took place and how they changed with each contribution. It would be great to learn how others would approach this. Thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working on a digital humanities project and would love to find others interested in collaborating. The project is called Kanon, and we're creating a digital library platform that facilitates social annotation of classic works of literature and art. We would be grateful to have help of any kind, both technical and advisory. You can see a rough mockup here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://kanon.lemon.ua/new/book.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://kanon.lemon.ua/new/book.html&#60;/a&#62; &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you may be interested, or know anyone who is, or where I can find collaborators, please contact me at &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:zacharysdavis@gmail.com&#34;&#62;zacharysdavis@gmail.com&#60;/a&#62; or reach me on skype at zacharysdavis.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you,&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am a Senior at the University of Mary Washington and have taken a couple of courses that look more into the field of Digital Humanities. Two of them being Digital History and Digital Storytelling. Unfortunately I am coming to that time where I have to start thinking about my future. I was wondering what kind of options are out there for those interested in the field of Digital Humanities. Would I need to go to graduate school to have a chance at finding a job within the field? Or do I have the basic skills I already need/ Are there internships or other programs that also support the field of Digital Humanities? I am actually more so interested in History because that is where I will get my bachelors. However I am open to any kind of advice. Thank you!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have been asked to give a talk to our faculty on &#34;Models of Collaboration in Digital Humanities Projects&#34; focusing on &#34;the possibilities and challenges of collaboration.&#34; It will probably be a general audience of humanities scholars, whose experience with digital projects may range from a lot to none.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This topic could be approached at so many levels that I'm not quite sure where to begin. I'm finding the following pages very helpful&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/category/collaboration/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/category/collaboration/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dancohen.org/category/collaboration/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.dancohen.org/category/collaboration/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;but would also be interested in pointers to other readings, or seeing a discussion here at DHanswers on how &#34;collaboration&#34; relates to &#34;digital humanities.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For the immediate purposes of my upcoming talk, I am most interested in discussing this at a practical level: What kinds of collaborations are needed to enable faculty to participate in or create digital humanities projects. And, conversely, what kinds of new collaborations does digital technology enable? And what is an effective way to introduce this topic to a general scholarly audience?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is perhaps a simplistic question, but as I prepare to discuss Digital Humanities with other departments on my campus, the need for articulating the relevance of Digital Humanities to a Dance Department are on my mind.  How have you articulated DH to the performance-based arts? Have you encountered resistance from the Arts in collaborating under the Humanities umbrella? What tools are used for preservation or data mining in the Arts?  ARTeFact comes to mind for dance. Music has &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.diggingintodata.org/Home/AwardRecipients2009/StructuralAnalysisofLargeAmountsofMusic/tabid/179/Default.aspx&#34;&#62;SALAMI&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://music-encoding.org/&#34;&#62;MEI&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(I'm not even sure where this kind of question should be housed on DH Answers.)

				<title>Eric Johnson on "Has anybody written a history of the digital humanities?"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/has-anybody-written-a-history-of-the-digital-humanities#post-558</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've often found myself wondering if anybody has written a book-length narrative history telling the story of humanities computing/digital humanities from the early days of humanities computing until now (or some approximation thereof), addressing major milestone DH projects, related efforts, and some of the big themes of the field as they've evolved--or haven't--over time?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I suspect that some histories may have been done that address particular disciplines (e.g. digital history), but have they been tied together and examined as a whole?  I see that the question has been addressed in conference presentations, such as those by &#60;a href=&#34;http://infomotions.com/blog/tag/digital-humanities/&#34;&#62;Joe Raben&#60;/a&#62; or &#60;a href=&#34;http://infomotions.com/blog/2010/05/cyberinfrastructure-days-at-the-university-of-notre-dame/&#34;&#62;Stéfan Sinclair&#60;/a&#62;, and appears in Chapter 1 of Schreibman et al.'s &#34;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/&#34;&#62;A Companion to Digital Humanities&#60;/a&#62;,&#34; but I wondered if anything longer has been published.  I may well have just sailed right past it.  Seems like it would make a great oral history project, too.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm currently working on a hypertext introductory program for advertising students.  I'm trying to steer clear of vertical transmission mode of teaching in favour of a more practise-focused, self-directed approach. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far I've found the teaching notes of Adrian Miles (&#60;a href=&#34;http://vogmae.net.au/research/thinking/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://vogmae.net.au/research/thinking/&#60;/a&#62;) and &#34;The Future of Learning&#34; (&#60;a href=&#34;http://startl.org/about/the-future-of-learning/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://startl.org/about/the-future-of-learning/&#60;/a&#62;) to be really useful.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have any recommended texts, thoughts, exercises or tips on how to go about this?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks guys!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A coworker of mine is looking for suggestions, trying to find material about the point of convergence between digital humanities and public history museums. I can think of a couple, but as I'm fairly new to the museum side of things, I thought I'd turn the question over to a larger body of folks who're in the know.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What should one read, if one is looking to sound well-informed when talking about such topics?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(Also, why is there no &#34;public humanities&#34; related category...?)
