			<description>&#60;p&#62;Where do you go for data to support your DH work aside from LAMs (library, archive, museum) specific repositories?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We have a DH project that's currently uses MySQL for the database, and it works very well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There has been much recent talk about NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB, promising flexibility and scalability. We're considering re-writing the backend. Is anyone in the DH community seriously using MongoDB?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you have used MongoDB for a DH project, what has been your experience with it? Biggest joy? Gotchas to look out for? Is conversion worth it for libraries and archives open source projects?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We'd like to point to freely available, well formatted TEI texts online (poetry, prose). Where is the best URL to send people? TEI By Example doesn't have whole texts. Projects Using TEI (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/&#60;/a&#62;) is somewhat difficult to peruse, can have dead links, and doesn't indicate if the texts are available or not. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any suggestions?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Miriam,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've been sketching out how I work here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://j.mp/digital-smg&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://j.mp/digital-smg&#60;/a&#62;  But for actual step-by-step workflow, take a look at Bill Turkel: &#60;a href=&#34;http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For a project I'm working on, I'd like to be able to feed the tweetstreams of a couple of different accounts into spreadsheets so they can be sorted different ways.  Does anybody know of an app or tool that does that on a live, rolling basis?  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've found a couple of descriptions of set-ups (like &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.manu-j.com/blog/view-twitter-updates-excel-google-docs-spreadsheet/237/&#34;&#62;this one&#60;/a&#62;) that do pull feeds in, but as far as I can see they mostly seem to cap off at about 20 tweets and require that they be refreshed manually.  Not the end of the world if that's the best that can be done, but not ideal.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A colleague from our Haiti Lab at the Franklin Humanities Institute asked my advice about the best ways to create a library of low res books that students in Haiti can access easily--thumb drives with low resolution pdf's, tagging low data &#34;canonical&#34; texts and archives (literary, historical) from internet cafes, excellent translations between English and Haitian Kreyol, etc.   This is the beginning of a conversation, obviously, but I'm so thrilled for DHAnswers (and delighted you posted this on the HASTAC site) that I thought I'd get this local conversation going for my colleagues by putting it out to our community and collecting and passing on responses. I know that questions of digital divide and digital access are not as key to all work in the Digital Humanities but I also know that many in our community have thought deeply about how we translate work in ways that make it accessible.   Thanks for any ideas, leads, sources, experts, anything anyone wants to contribute to this vital conversation.

				<title>Shane Landrum on "Good, fast metadata management for digital photos of archival items?"</title>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;As a historian working on a dissertation, I'm looking for a good, open-source, Mac-friendly metadata tool for managing the gigabytes of digital photos I've taken of archival materials. Adobe Lightroom's features are close, but it's an expensive piece of software and doesn't solve my problems well. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Mostly, I want a way to add arbitrary metadata to an individual image or batch of images. It might be citation-related (&#34;Every JPG in this folder or its subfolders is from the Jane Texas Papers, and this subfolder is from Box 1...&#34;), subject-related, author-related, or idiosyncratically related to my own research questions. (Think of a sociologist or anthropologist coding interview data.) In an ideal world, it would be able to support a &#34;transcription&#34; field. JPEG/EXIF metadata fields seem unwieldy, not to mention that they're easy to clobber accidentally. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've looked into DSpace as a repository system (and even installed it on my laptop), but it's overkill for single-researcher use at the dissertation level, not to mention a huge amount of work to set up. I don't have access to an institutional DSpace for building my own collections, or else that might be a good answer (from what I know of it).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Really, what I want is a research workflow system for digital reference images. I want to be able to easily, quickly mark and categorize the items in my (very large) collections according to arbitrary categories; find the items I'm looking for using a faceted search; transcribe them in some cases, but not all; know what I haven't looked at yet, but need to; cite the item I'm looking at; etc. Zotero isn't really suited for this, nor is Bookends (my preferred desktop citation manager).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If such a tool doesn't exist for making this process easier, are there established best practices for setting up a home-hacked metadata and workflow system of my own? I've been hacking around with Ruby scripts that store this metadata in nearby text or YAML files, but those haven't worked as well as I'd like.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What's the best practice for choosing filenames for large projects. Is there an archival standard that one should use?
