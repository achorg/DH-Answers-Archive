			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working on a collaborative student website on Scottish Poetry and I want the site to include recordings of poems in Scots and Gaelic. I would like to have some flexibility where the plugin is positioned on the front end. Any advice gratefully received. Alison

			<description>&#60;p&#62;At Columbia University we are embarking on a two year program to re-skill our librarians to be the consulting arm of our re-envisioned Digital Humanities Center. We are not finding much on our environmental scan other than @trevormu√±oz' DH Incubator, some of the work that @karikraus is doing, and the work at Indiana by Angela Courtney (@englishlitlib) and Harriett Green (@greenharr) at Illinois. Do you know more? Let's get this band on the road.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Lately, I've noticed that questions have been very general and grandiose, so I thought I would take it back to the mundane a bit by trying out a technical question. The question itself is a bit of an experiment also, since I imagine it belongs more on the Zotero forum. I'm wonder what kind of productive overlap we can have between the two forums. The question came about after I saw &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mwidner&#34;&#62;@&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/mwidner'&#62;mwidner&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/a&#62; posted a link to &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelwidner.com/courses/e314lspring2011&#34;&#62;a new course&#60;/a&#62; where he will be using a zotero feed of his student's collaborative bibliography. I figure I could write to him, or play with the RSS until I figure it out, but then I thought an answer here would be more useful to the larger community. I will be happy to answer my self if I figure it out tonight, but if you have a ready answer feel free.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We are an international multiblogging platform, Hypotheses.org, and we are looking for an antispam: we currently use recapchta but we have the feeling that it is not as good as it was, and we regularly recieve a large number of spams.&#60;br /&#62;
We know Askimet but its prices are really high.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does someone know an other efficient antispam? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the help
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi all. Over the years, I've constructed my course web sites with a variety of tools: Blackboard and other proprietary systems, hand-coded html/css, and Google Sites. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd like to start using a CMS -- partially because I'm not totally satisfied with any of these prior tools and partially because I'd like to force myself to get a little more acquainted with a useful CMS system that I might teach my students down the road.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have strong feelings about which CMS offers the best combo of features for building course sites and is a technology that would be valuable/feasible for students to learn? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I teach graduate-level new media courses; the students I teach typically go on to work in communication roles in smaller organizations or as consultants to smaller or mid-sized organizations. They may be tasked with post-graduation jobs like designing and implementing web sites and blogs or integrating all of an organization's social and online communications.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Before I learn yet another tool, I'd like to feel like it's one that will continue to be useful for educational and organizational content-management tasks for the foreseeable future. Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Is Askimet still available for free for university installations of WordPressMU? Or IT office reports: &#34;Back when we initially started looking into Akismet, there was a free option listed that had the requirements that you describe, but it seems to no longer be detailed as an option.&#34;
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For Hypotheses.org, a platform for scholarly blogs in human and social sciences, we need to implement a feature like LinkWithin. Do you know a Wordpress plugin doing the same thing, but without using a third party server? Thank you!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;About LinkWithin : &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.linkwithin.com/learn&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.linkwithin.com/learn&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;About Hypotheses.org : &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.hypotheses.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.hypotheses.org&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Karin - how about a WordPress plugin?  Something like &#60;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7/faq/&#34;&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;, maybe?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
