			<description>&#60;p&#62;You may also want to consider using Polinode. At the moment, Polinode lets you not only visualize and analyze network data like Gephi, but also to collect network data via highly-flexible relationship surveys. You are also able to import network data for analysis from an Excel file or in JSON or GEXF format. If you are interested, you can check out a short video at our website (full disclosure: I am the founder):&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We just renovated a physics lab into a SCALE-UP format room. I'll digitize our plans and send 'em along to your gmail, if that's ok.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I will say this: The thing that people talked about the most during planning was literally the tables: what was the right size and shape to accommodate group work; to allow for free-and-easy movement around the tables, including up-and-down to the ubiquitous walltalker writing surfaces, etc. That took a lot of effort.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It has been pretty cool, though.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello - I am writing a proposal to renovate a traditional, fixed seating computer lab as a SCALE-UP style classroom suitable for teaching DH (among other things). What do you suggest for set up? Furniture, laptops, monitors, budget for software, etc. If anyone has a classroom and budget for a similar project, that would be especially helpful. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Caroline

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You might want to use Social Networks Visualizer from &#60;a href=&#34;http://socnetv.sourceforge.net&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://socnetv.sourceforge.net&#60;/a&#62; It is a open-source, cross-platform graphical application for analysis and visualization of social networks. It allows you to load or create and modify social networks in a canvas, rotate, zoom, change node attributes, analyse their social and mathematical properties and apply visualization layouts for relevant presentation in papers etc. Can create known social datasets automatically as well as random networks and small worlds. Computes basic graph properties, such as density, diameter, geodesics, connectedness, eccentricity, etc. It also calculates advanced measures for social network analysis such as centrality and prestige indices (i.e. closeness centrality, betweeness centrality, information centrality, proximity and rank prestige), triad census, cliques, clustering coefficient, etc.

&#60;p&#62;+1 to Vagrant. Vagrant's portability also means that if lab users get to a good point with a Vagrant instance on a lab machine, they should be more or less able to take a copy of the Vagrant instance with them.

&#60;p&#62;An update to #1 on my list: MAMP Pro 3 (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/&#60;/a&#62;) now lets you spin up a number of CMS sites (most importantly, Wordpress and Drupal) with a few clicks. Another option is to set up Vagrant (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.vagrantup.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.vagrantup.com/&#60;/a&#62;) to quickly and easily set up dev environments (including CMSs) that don't affect the host computer and can be ported to a live site easily (because Vagrant uses virtual machines, it's easier to make your dev and live environments exactly the same as to all those finicky server details like what version of PHP you're running, than it is with MAMP). Vagrant's site has user-friendly documentation, and it would be pretty easy for someone to create a several-step &#34;here's how to create your own Drupal or WP site on this lab machine&#34; flyer.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Many thanks, all, for your very helpful replies!&#60;br /&#62;
@Scott S: do I ever know what you mean about gephi. Sigh. d3 is nice but requires a few lessons itself and is really focused on visualization, whereas gephi has lots of analysis. Network analysis packages for R or other languages make more sense, I guess, and everyone can just start climbing the learning curve. It seems as though there is no alternative &#34;all in one&#34; network program that works across platforms.&#60;br /&#62;
@Scott K: hear, hear on RStudio.&#60;br /&#62;
@Ethan: my request was generic because this has to serve a broad range of current and future DH uses. So it's great to know what might be needed in archaeology and art history. Obviously I'm text-centric...&#60;br /&#62;
@Josh: your guide is just the sort of thing I've been searching for. OCR: yes. Sublime text 2: didn't realize it was cross platform; that's great.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've listed some popular software pieces in &#60;a href=&#34;http://sites.library.northwestern.edu/dh/tools-resources/&#34;&#62;this DH guide&#60;/a&#62;, and I would also highly recommend &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.sublimetext.com/&#34;&#62;Sublime Text 2&#60;/a&#62; for a text editor. Oxygen is worth it if you're doing any XML encoding work, and I would also suggest ABBYY or another OCR software being available in the lab. And don't forget about &#60;a href=&#34;http://dirt.projectbamboo.org/&#34;&#62;Bamboo DiRT&#60;/a&#62; for finding, evaluating, and reviewing digital research tools. Good luck!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It depends on your use case.  Particular tools vary from discipline to discipline.  Can you speak more about what you plan to teach or that types of research your students might conduct?  If I were teaching digital methods in art history or archaeology, I'd load up VisualSFM or PhotoScan for photogrammetry and Reflectance Transformation Imaging software in addition to GIS software.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Software and hardware requirements will change over time, so physical space may be the more important consideration. I recommend a central laptop &#34;hub&#34; on movable tables (don't forget outlet access), and large screen workstations, whiteboards, and projection areas along the walls.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have used XAMPP (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html&#60;/a&#62;) for PHP/MySQL development very successfully. It also runs Python, though I have chosen to go with a separate installation using Anaconda (&#60;a href=&#34;http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html)&#60;/a&#62;. There is a 64-bit version, and it has an impressive array of pre-installed packages useful for DH, some of which can be tricky to install on your own. My only complete is that the wonderful Spyder IDE (&#60;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/)--worth&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/)--worth&#60;/a&#62; installing on its own--tends to crash occasionally in the Anaconda environment. But a little Googling revealed that deleting the temporary file folder restores functionality, so I'm not too bothered.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would also recommend R Studio (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.com/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.rstudio.com/)&#60;/a&#62;, and impressive IDE for R (see also the web-development version Shiny in the nav menu).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Don't forget Git/GitHub for Windows!&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;To make a quick and partial start to an answer to this great question: I can chime in with positive experiences with MAMP (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html&#60;/a&#62;) and, less extensively, WAMP (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.wampserver.com/en/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.wampserver.com/en/&#60;/a&#62;) for Drupal, Wordpress, and Omeka local installations.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Networks: This past quarter I worked on network visualizations with students on Mac and Windows, and Gephi was frustratingly buggy for students on both (UI problems and numerous instances of crashes and spontaneously lost data).  I'm considering teaching students to use D3.js (d3js.org) in the future, which gets students down and dirty in JavaScript with about the same learning curve as Gephi's UI. (D3 doesn't have all the analytics built-in, but there are packages out there for running those analytics in python - see &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.jgoodwin.net/?p=1223&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.jgoodwin.net/?p=1223&#60;/a&#62; for one D3 workflow visualizing journal co-citations.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Finally, would installing a Linux distribution (say, Debian) through VirtualBox be cheating?  That might be useful for students wanting to learn ruby and python in a &#34;sandbox&#34; on a Windows machine. The clone-ability of the virtual machines/states seems like a plus, from an administrative standpoint (for keeping uniform versions of ruby and gems, especially). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Looking forward to seeing others' answers!  Scott

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Last year Michael Widner asked a similar question &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-hardware-and-software-would-you-put-in-a-dhmultimedia-lab&#34;&#62;about hardware and software&#60;/a&#62;, but I'm wondering whether you had more specific ideas about the distinct software needs of&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;a DH &#60;a&#62;teaching&#60;/a&#62; setup (imagine a pc classroom. And when I say PC, I mean, sigh, Windows)
&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;a DH &#60;a&#62;research&#60;/a&#62; (&#34;'&#34;lab&#34;'&#34;) setup (more latitude here about platforms, but fewer machines, meant for more focused use).
&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Let's assume that really elaborate custom setups for specific projects and public-facing stuff will be managed elsewhere: I'm thinking about a starter kit suitable for many uses and many levels of expertise. I have a feel for the possibilities on Mac, but am hopeless on Windows. Other *nix is probably not on the menu right now.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;End of question. Thank you all so much for any ideas at all!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The rest (sorry for the long post) is some notes on ideas so far:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;text editors: eclipse, komodo edit, oXygen (worth it?)&#60;br /&#62;
single-platform: textwrangler, notepad++ (better choices?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;browsers: all&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;ssh and ftp clients (are putty and cyberduck still okay for windows?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;languages / environments: what counts as &#34;starter kit&#34; for: python, ruby, R?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;network analysis: gephi. others?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;gis software (worth it?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On the earlier thread Amanda Visconti suggested &#34;guest computers&#34; with the *AMP stack + typical CMS's. Any experience with making these sandboxes for omeka, wordpress, drupal?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Media production software is not high on my list, but tell me if I'll regret that.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you all again!
