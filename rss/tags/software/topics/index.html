			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am developing a data set that charts the relationships between rabbis in antiquity.  I am now keeping this data in tabular form (rabbi x/term of relationship/rabbi y).  Could anyone recommend a software package - preferably open source and not too difficult to use - that can help me visualize and analyze this data?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello - I am writing a proposal to renovate a traditional, fixed seating computer lab as a SCALE-UP style classroom suitable for teaching DH (among other things). What do you suggest for set up? Furniture, laptops, monitors, budget for software, etc. If anyone has a classroom and budget for a similar project, that would be especially helpful. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you could build your own DH lab, what would you stock it with? Anything from AV equipment to software to computer hardware is fair game. I'm envisioning a place where graduate students (mainly) and others would have the space and tools to experiment, learn, and do research and/or produce media.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Aside: I notice there's not a category in DHAnswers for these sorts of infrastructure questions.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Last year Michael Widner asked a similar question &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-hardware-and-software-would-you-put-in-a-dhmultimedia-lab&#34;&#62;about hardware and software&#60;/a&#62;, but I'm wondering whether you had more specific ideas about the distinct software needs of&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;a DH &#60;a&#62;teaching&#60;/a&#62; setup (imagine a pc classroom. And when I say PC, I mean, sigh, Windows)
&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;a DH &#60;a&#62;research&#60;/a&#62; (&#34;'&#34;lab&#34;'&#34;) setup (more latitude here about platforms, but fewer machines, meant for more focused use).
&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Let's assume that really elaborate custom setups for specific projects and public-facing stuff will be managed elsewhere: I'm thinking about a starter kit suitable for many uses and many levels of expertise. I have a feel for the possibilities on Mac, but am hopeless on Windows. Other *nix is probably not on the menu right now.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;End of question. Thank you all so much for any ideas at all!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The rest (sorry for the long post) is some notes on ideas so far:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;text editors: eclipse, komodo edit, oXygen (worth it?)&#60;br /&#62;
single-platform: textwrangler, notepad++ (better choices?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;browsers: all&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;ssh and ftp clients (are putty and cyberduck still okay for windows?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;languages / environments: what counts as &#34;starter kit&#34; for: python, ruby, R?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;network analysis: gephi. others?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;gis software (worth it?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On the earlier thread Amanda Visconti suggested &#34;guest computers&#34; with the *AMP stack + typical CMS's. Any experience with making these sandboxes for omeka, wordpress, drupal?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Media production software is not high on my list, but tell me if I'll regret that.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you all again!

				<title>olaf on "How create a real (with page numbers) index of journal&#039;s entire run, from PDFs?"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-create-a-real-with-page-numbers-index-of-journals-entire-run-from-pdfs#post-1904</link>
			<pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2013 17:57:10 +0000</pubDate>
			<dc:creator>olaf</dc:creator>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">1904@http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/</guid>
			<description>&#60;p&#62;I need to index all back issues of &#60;em&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://mamluk.uchicago.edu&#34;&#62;Mamluk Studies Review&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/em&#62; (open access, now digital only but formerly print) but have not had much luck finding ideas about how to go about it.&#60;br /&#62;
Searching the Web for info about indexing PDFs leads largely to results about indexing them on a computer for improved searches, or to indexing services.&#60;br /&#62;
I hope to find software (or scripts or something!) that can &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;read PDF files&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;understand the idea of page numbers&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;understand that each page in a pdf is a distinct entity&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;handle Unicode and diacritics (and, ideally, Arabic script)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;see phrases or hyphenated words that break across pages as single items&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't expect anything to happen automatically: I know I (or better yet an unwary grad student) will have to actually go through and mark words and phrases to be included in the index.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Bonus points if it can be taught to ignore certain strings when alphabetizing. For example, since 'al-' is Arabic for 'the', it doesn't affect alphabetization (so al-Nasir Muhammad goes in the N section).&#60;br /&#62;
Similarly, there needs to be a way to instruct it that ā and a are the same for purposes of alphabetization, as are ṣ and s, etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Super bonus points if it can recognize (or learn to recognize) variations on a word or phrase in terms of spelling (often inconsistent when transliteration is involved), word order or intervening words.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What I have: 23 issues of the journal as whole-book pdfs, as well as individual pdfs of all articles. Unfortunately, the first half dozen or so were created without Unicode, using proprietary fonts with non-standard encodings. Messy, but I can work around it somehow. I also have InDesign files (various versions) for about half the issues. This will all be done in Windows (32-bit XP and 64-bit 7). I always have the latest version of Acrobat (not reader, the full program).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The resulting index will be posted on the Web, probably both as a PDF and in some more dynamic and usable format(s). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any ideas for ways to streamline this would be appreciated. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Olaf

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For a friend who is studying the manuscripts of John Selden, can anyone recommend collation software?  I see that Collate is still in use, and &#60;a href=&#34;http://juxtasoftware.org&#34;&#62;Juxta&#60;/a&#62; looks promising.  Learning of related projects that use the tool and share techniques would also be helpful.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What would you name as the top technical innovations of DH -- or some of the most important and broadly applicable science-and-techology contributions that can be reasonably claimed by the (digital) humanities?  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm thinking of things like XML, as developed by Michael Sperberg-McQueen and other computing humanists, and would appreciate references not only to standards and protocols, but to important algorithms and tools.  I can name a few more of my own, but am writing something on behalf of the ACH community, so would like to engage the wisdom of the crowd!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I would like to use LSI (latent semantic indexing) to provide access within the public library to a local history collection which I have been scanning (usually newspaper pages or clippings; using the Paper Port software which came with our Brother all-in-one scan/fax/copy machine).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While I've read the &#34;right tool(s)for an archive of newspaper columns&#34; post, I do not have copyright clearance for the scanned material, nor do I seek to put it online, as most of the suggested tools seem to do. DevonThink seems to be out, as we're strictly Windows(including a few 7's)-- no Macs.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We're also perpetually broke (who isn't?), and unlikely to spend anything on this project, including renting IT help--have none in-house. Although I'm motivated to do the text cleanup of the scanned corpus, I'm not too tech-savvy, nor am I a mathematician. (I have a bad case of English-major-brain; it gets all fuzzy somewhere around the word &#34;vector&#34;). I still hope we can transcend our limitations and those of keyword indexing. Any help?  Any suggestions? Thanks! DH

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm super excited to be &#34;Introduction to Digital Humanities&#34; this fall. As I've been turning over the course in my mind, I've known that I've wanted to do one or more projects with the students, probably using our special collections, which tend to be quite strong in particular swaths of literature. This week I sat down with &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/LizChaseMARBL&#34;&#62;Liz Chase&#60;/a&#62;, one of our special collections librarians, and brainstormed. We came up with a great project involving &#60;a href=&#34;http://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/duffy834/?keywords=duffy&#34;&#62;our holdings of Carol Ann Duffy's notebooks&#60;/a&#62;. In short, we want to do some comparisons between how she writes in her 1999 volume, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Wife-Carol-Ann-Duffy/dp/057119995X/briacrox-20&#34;&#62;The World's Wife&#60;/a&#62;, and her previous volumes. We're interested in thematic material, vocabulary she uses, poetic styles, and so forth. But as I've been working to design the project, I've come to realize that the students' work (to say nothing of my teaching) will be improved by the inclusion of some readings on textual scholarship along these lines. &#60;strong&#62;But I don't know this field at all.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What's more, I've been trying to think about what sort of software we might most profitably use to help push our analysis after creating a dataset of the texts. I'm guessing we'll want to represent word counts, word clouds, line structures, and more. My first thought is &#60;a href=&#34;http://seasr.org/&#34;&#62;SEASR&#60;/a&#62;, but I'm not familiar with the tool and I'm not sure if it's overkill or underkill or totally off the mark. I can always use &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.wordle.net/&#34;&#62;Wordle&#60;/a&#62;, but I would like to have more options. And perhaps if I really knew this field of scholarship then it would be easier for me to know which tools I should be using.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What I really need, then, is a suggestion of books or articles that I should read so that our class proceeds thoughtfully on the project with an understanding of what's been done in the past. Any tool suggestions would be welcome as well.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Looking for software to do audio transcription of linguistic interviews. The ideal package will be able to synch audio and transcript, export output in some sanely archivable form, be installed/used by relatively non-technical users, and do a little light audio editing (mostly to cut out bits that could threaten someone's privacy).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What's out there?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A bit of voyeurism on this Sunday evening: there's no shortage of opinions on best applications out there (and @ProfHacker often has great suggestions), but I'm curious what my DH colleagues and friends commonly use as apps. This question was initially motivated by my continued flirting with Linux (and a desire to bootstrap my knowledge of useful stuff), but I'd suggest the net be cast across platforms. Here are a few of applications I use most often with some very subjective commentary:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Firefox&#60;/strong&#62; I know a lot of people complain that it's slow, but I actually haven't found that, maybe because I have a ton of RAM (that's not to say that Javascript intensive sites run as fast as they do in Chrome, but for the vast majority of sites I don't see a difference). I've also ported by profile between machines so many times that I'm very comfortable that I won't lose things (whereas the profile situation for Chrome on Mac is much less clear to me) – I think both Firefox and Chrome are moving to synchronized profiles, so that may be less of an issue in the future. I also still prefer Firefox's location bar and its suggestions, and I also find Firefox on the whole more customizable. I mostly use Firebug and Zotero for extensions (plus a couple more)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Thunderbird&#60;/strong&#62; I've actually just shifted back to TBird from Apple Mail – I like the UI of Mail, but the lack of good shortcuts drives me insane (you can set keyboard shortcuts in system preference for individual apps, but I find them flaky). I've also just now installed Lightning for calendars and I really like how it's integrated into my mail screen&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Eclipse&#60;/strong&#62; Yep, I love it for just about all the coding I do: Java, XML, PHP, Javascript, Ruby, Python, etc. I really like the team plugins (SVN and Git)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Textmate&#60;/strong&#62; I can't quite explain why, but I usually come back to Textmate for very quick editing, either code or plain text&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Textwrangler&#60;/strong&#62; I'll use this instead of Eclipse or Textmate if I need to open very large files&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Dropbox&#60;/strong&#62; No need to say much here...&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Screenflow&#60;/strong&#62; I like this for video capture and editing (QuickTime works well for capture but lacks some of the editing features&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Omnifocus&#60;/strong&#62; I try to use this properly but usually end up piling up a bunch of stuff in there and then not really going back to the list as I should&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Expandrive&#60;/strong&#62; I like the Finder integration of this for SFTP&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Keynote&#60;/strong&#62; I still prefer this for presentations&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;OpenOffice&#60;/strong&#62; I do my best to use this, but I still find that going back and forth from MS Word isn't always as smooth as it should be (especially for lists)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Ripit&#60;/strong&#62; To, um, make a backup of DVDs for cultural prosperity&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Voilà&#60;/strong&#62; Powerful screen-capture and editing (yes, you can do most of it with free software, but...&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;etc. (Skype, VLC, Echofon, Handbrake, Audacity...)
&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I go back and forth with the opensource and free software: I don't mind paying for applications, though I do tend to prefer the customizability of open software. I'm also making more and more effort to have most things in the cloud to ensure that I'm not too locked into any one system.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What do you use?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
