&#60;p&#62;You are right, it is a difficult search. I may have, perhaps, misstated the object of my search. I am in fact looking for a graduate programme of any kind that deals with digital culture/art/literature from a theoretical perspective. I have an undergraduate degree and I thought it would make sense to aim for graduate programmes. It is my understanding that I can apply for either master's programmes or doctoral programmes, but I assumed that it would be easier to be admitted to a master's. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I also need funding in order to study abroad, in any form, whether it be a scholarship or tuition waiver or some scheme in which I can work or do research in order to support myself.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Perhaps I should have made  myself clearer from the beginning. The sort of research I aim to do is best described in this (soon to be published) text: &#60;a href=&#34;http://mariuslobontiu.ro/2010/09/playing-the-text-a-call-for-theory-in-digital-fiction/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mariuslobontiu.ro/2010/09/playing-the-text-a-call-for-theory-in-digital-fiction/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much for your help.

&#60;p&#62;It is in fact a lifelong dream of mine to study in London. I just assumed that funding options were far more limited than in the US, so I thought it would be more realistic to just apply there. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I see that the programme you suggest has quite a comprehensive list of scolarships and international student funding, so I will definitely apply (in spite of the fact that it is not 100% what I was looking for - but it is close enough). I will also start looking for other post-graduate programmes in or around London that deal with digital culture/literature/art. Thank you very much for your suggestion!

&#60;p&#62;Thank you for your answer. I am in fact looking for a master's in which to study digital art and literature from a theoretical perspective, rather than library and information science. I apologize if my initial question was misleading, and, again, thank you.

&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much for your suggestions. I am indeed more interested in studying digital art and fiction. I have been trying the exact approach you mention for quite some time (googling DH and its synonyms) but I haven't found as many programmes as I had hoped. That's why I turned to this forum (and I'm very glad I did!).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far I've been taking the centres listed here ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/&#60;/a&#62; ) one by one, hoping to find a post-graduate programme associated with them. It's going slow and I'm not sure if this is the right list to start from. Is there any other list that you might know of, that would be helpful?

&#60;p&#62;From my discussions with the co-director of the program, it is my understanding that LUC's program is terminal based. The intention is to prepare students to work in careers in DH. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That being said, my interest in the program is as a gateway to my PhD in English. My interests are in textual studies, more specifically serial publications in Victorian England. A program such as this gives options either furthering education afterward or getting right into the field.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm building a Zotero collection focused on DH undergraduate, masters, and PhD programs.  It's a little rough, but you may find some useful information in it: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities_education/items/collection/2950956&#34;&#62;http://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities_education/items/collection/2950956&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It's hard for me to wrap my head around the concept of &#34;Digital Humanities&#34; as a stand-alone master's degree program.  It seems to me that it would make more sense to go to a graduate program (history, English, art history, etc.) that has a progressive view toward technology applications in those disciplines.  Both programs listed (UCL/Loyola-Chicago) seem to me more like professional degrees than humanities degrees that involved a great deal technology applied to scholarly endeavors.

&#60;p&#62;Though this is a list of undergraduate programs with DH inflection, it might help to see if any of these also offer graduate programs:&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;And why just the US? Come to London! We are starting our new MA in Digital Humanities at UCL in September 2011. &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/courses/mamsc&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/courses/mamsc&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;

&#60;p&#62;In addition to looking at masters programs that are labeled &#34;digital humanities,&#34; I'd recommend that you look at masters programs in the iSchools (www.ischools.org), which are mostly (but not all) schools with masters in library and information science.  DH fits well into many of these programs and is represented among their faculty.  At Illinois (wwww.lis.illinois.edu), we have a number of courses and faculty members relevant to this interest, and we deliver the degree both online (in a hybrid, partly synchronous format) and on campus...

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The University of Maryland's Professor Matt Kirschenbaum has written a blog post on this topic that might be a good starting place for you: &#60;a href=&#34;http://otal.umd.edu/~mgk/blog/archives/000869.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://otal.umd.edu/~mgk/blog/archives/000869.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Although you'll want to do more research to turn up newer programs (the post was written five years ago), Matt makes a good point: when applying to programs, think about where you see yourself going. Are you interested in working in a more traditional humanities community but with digital tools? Do you want to create electronic art or work in a DH center? Does a program, digital or not, have faculty who are willing to mentor the kind of work you'd like to do?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Try Googling some of the synonyms for DH such as humanities computing, digital studies, etc. I found my current program by researching university DH centers, then looking into the programs associated with the centers. I noticed that good DH centers were almost always linked with at least one strong academic department, but that those strong departments weren't always in my particular area of interest. If you're attracted to a school on the grounds of the work you see coming from their DH center, look at which departments share a strong linkage with the center (e.g. shared faculty, workshop sponsorship).
