			<description>&#60;p&#62;It depends (of course!). I think the tagging is about the same. For search, Omeka is designed for librarians and other cultural heritage folks, so it places a strong emphasis on how information is organized (it uses the Dublin Core metadata standard...if that means anything to you). As you can see from one of Omeka's &#60;a href=&#34;http://braceroarchive.org/items/advanced-search&#34;&#62;advanced search pages&#60;/a&#62; there are many different fields to search, but this could be meaningless if you only need to search 1 or 2 fields.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks Zach!&#60;br /&#62;
Yes, we're using Wordpress in the group to present and organise the participants' work, but I'm looking around for something more, but I don't know if I'll know what I want til I find it! :)&#60;br /&#62;
Thanks - I don't know Drupal will check it out - am I right that Omeka has a superior search/tag function to Wordpress?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!!&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Shireen,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Have you considered a regular ol' content management system such as WordPress, Drupal, or even Omeka? I think any of those would meet the criteria you mention.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Best of luck with your project,&#60;br /&#62;
Zach

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi there. I have just come across this forum and am learning a lot from it - thank you. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am a PhD candidate in Dublin working on a participatory media ethnography.&#60;br /&#62;
I am keeping an ethnographic fieldwork journal and records include text, image and video generated by me and my participants and also content from and activity on internet locations . . . it's a lot of various media to juggle and in particular the live nature of internet sources such as social media platforms are proving a challenge to capture without deadening it by simply screen grabbing. I'm trying to recreate some of this using editing and graphics software as this is my professional background but I'm looking for other possibilities. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Equally, I am on the hunt for packages that may be useful tools in maintaining my digital research diary in a coherent way. I have, through following suggestions in response to relevant questions in this forum, had a look at Scrivener and DevonThink.&#60;br /&#62;
Would you have any further suggestions for managing various media (independent (uploaded by us) audio, video, image and web sources) that offers good search functions, cross referencing between pages/sections - and in a way that facilitates embedded/inline video and image with room to write through these assets. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Seems to me Scrivener and DevonThink are good options - but as a newcomer to these, I'm well aware others may be around the corner! &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks so much.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;I hear you on this; and I don't think it has to be. It's as much teaching undergraduates* how to use the already effective tools that are out there -- how 18th century English Lit studies are changed by the accessibility of ECCO, EEBO, and the Burney Collection,** for example.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;*And even graduate students, staff, faculty, in some cases.&#60;br /&#62;
**Not that I'm blithely assuming that all colleges and unis have access to these tools.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I agree with you that interpretations of textual, visual, geographical, archaeological, etc. data within the humanities are digital humanities.  Almost everything I have done professionally or academically over the last six years has been DH, from GIS to 3D visualization to cultural heritage informatics.  I'm not going split hairs as to whether TEI and data mining are web-based or not, but I find myself increasingly frustrated by conversations about &#34;How do we teach/introduce students to DH,&#34; and all of the answers relate to some form of web development: designing a database schema, learning HTML/CSS.  These are things that are of limited usefulness in many humanities disciplines.  I understand that people will suggest skills based on their own experience, but DH is losing out a lot of experienced technologists and scholars from non-textual fields, and as I have observed DH becoming more and more narrowly focused, voices in the textual humanities fields have greater and greater influence (control, even) over what is or is not &#34;Digital Humanities.&#34;  That is why I suggest that people who call themselves digital humanists ought to reconsider their notion of DH.  I think the field is much bigger than they realize, and thus needs to be more inclusive.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Ethan Gruber's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-do-we-introduce-undergraduates-to-the-digital-humanities/page/2#post-1583&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have to say, I disagree with most, if not all, of this. There is plenty of coding work in DH that is not web-related. Text-mining and distant reading are examples, as is work encoding texts in TEI. I think I remember some very awesome visualizations of ancient architecture, too, that I would call non-web DH coding? :)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The thing that I disagree with most is the idea that we (counting myself as a digital humanist) need to rethink our notion of the Digital Humanities. Like the #transformDH hashtag, it is predicated on a set idea of DH that I do not think exists. It seems like less than a year ago that there was still very active discussion about the role of code in DH, what skills could/should be part of it, and how it all fits together. No one, I think, ever came up with a notion of DH that had widespread consensus as being a good definition. Now, it seems, we are chasing after responses to a non-existent notion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, I do see the existence of two branches of DH, with different histories. In broad strokes, one is the &#34;Humanities Computing&#34; branch, on is indeed the more web-oriented branch (which shares more in common with ed tech). This has been recounted many times before, sometimes in this very site.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd ask that we all recognize the youth of DH, and this it is -- whatever it is! -- still developing through informal channels like THATCamps and blogs and twitter conversation, and through the institutional decisions made by administrators and through cluster hires. In short, I think it is far too early to say that DH is far too focused on textual disciplines. It might be at present, but the ultimate constitution of DH is still very much to be determined. Awesome visualization and interpretation of data -- textual, architectual, visual, geographical, temporal, archaeological, and more -- through digital/code-based means can and should be part of DH. I consider it to be implicit that it _is_, but maybe hasn't had as much attention as other aspects. Seems parallel to the Theory and DH questions that way?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Is learning to code even important in Digital Humanities?  I argue that it's not.  There are particular technologies that are relevant to various disciplines in the humanities, and web development isn't necessarily one of them (since coding always refers to web development in DH contexts).  Digital Humanities, capital D capital H, is far too focused on the textual disciplines and hardly inclusive of the humanities as a whole.  Digital Humanists ought to reconsider their notion of the Digital Humanities.  If you wonder why computer scientists are reluctant to get involved in Capital D Capital H, it's for this reason.  There are actually a great many computer scientists involved elsewhere in the humanities.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for all the great answers!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To update this forum, two of the respondents (Brian Croxall and Jeff McClurken) along with Ryan Cordell spoke about &#34;Teaching DH 101: Introduction to the Digital Humanities&#34; for NITLE's Digital Scholarship Seminars in December.  You can access the recording from the event website:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This seminar prompted a couple of posts on the NITLE blog because the presenters didn't really address coding for undergrads.  Here are a couple of posts that adress that issue:&#60;br /&#62;
Can Humanities Undergrads Learn to Code? by undergrads who learned to code in a humanities course at Pitt &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#60;/a&#62; (The answer is yes!!)&#60;br /&#62;
More Coding for Humanities Undergrads by Kathryn Tomasek, Wheaton College (again yes!!) &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The qualitative text analysis program, MAXQDA, allows you to code and annotate pdf, doc, txt, and rtf files--so it's possible later to search and retrieve across photos, website content, interview transcriptions, academic articles, etc.  There's also a new web-based software called Dedoose that works in a similar way--definitely a tool that could be used to organize digital humanities and multimedia social sciences projects.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'll mention two pieces of software and give you a link to blog posts I've found that explain their utility in this context:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Scrivener - a great research/writing tool for Mac (and now Windows).  Even compiles into Epub or Kindle (.mobi) if desired.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.organizingcreativity.com/2009/08/scrivener-a-perfect-program-for-dissertation-writing/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.organizingcreativity.com/2009/08/scrivener-a-perfect-program-for-dissertation-writing/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;

&#60;p&#62;DevonThink Pro - for storage/retrieval of research materials&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://idlethink.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/on-devonthink-and-history-research-i/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://idlethink.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/on-devonthink-and-history-research-i/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Someone mentioned this, sort of, but I've become a believer in Evernote as of late. I can save any type of media, and add comments right in the note, then using tags, organize my notes in folders. In addition to Evernote, and keeping with the simplicity theme, Dropbox is as easy as it gets for syncing and keeping things in order, in my opinion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for a name for the workshop:&#60;br /&#62;

&#60;p&#62;Agreed, manual item by item editing in Omeka is still a drag though it's possible to avoid some of this by keeping one's catalog/metadata in a database or Excel and periodically uploading this to Omeka as CSV.
