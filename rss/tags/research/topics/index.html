			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi there. I have just come across this forum and am learning a lot from it - thank you. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am a PhD candidate in Dublin working on a participatory media ethnography.&#60;br /&#62;
I am keeping an ethnographic fieldwork journal and records include text, image and video generated by me and my participants and also content from and activity on internet locations . . . it's a lot of various media to juggle and in particular the live nature of internet sources such as social media platforms are proving a challenge to capture without deadening it by simply screen grabbing. I'm trying to recreate some of this using editing and graphics software as this is my professional background but I'm looking for other possibilities. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Equally, I am on the hunt for packages that may be useful tools in maintaining my digital research diary in a coherent way. I have, through following suggestions in response to relevant questions in this forum, had a look at Scrivener and DevonThink.&#60;br /&#62;
Would you have any further suggestions for managing various media (independent (uploaded by us) audio, video, image and web sources) that offers good search functions, cross referencing between pages/sections - and in a way that facilitates embedded/inline video and image with room to write through these assets. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Seems to me Scrivener and DevonThink are good options - but as a newcomer to these, I'm well aware others may be around the corner! &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks so much.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Miriam,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've been sketching out how I work here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://j.mp/digital-smg&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://j.mp/digital-smg&#60;/a&#62;  But for actual step-by-step workflow, take a look at Bill Turkel: &#60;a href=&#34;http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
