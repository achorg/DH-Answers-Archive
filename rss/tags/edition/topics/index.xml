			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm trying to help a scholar who'd like to create a website that can do two things:&#60;br /&#62;
1) Display a digitized songbook; and&#60;br /&#62;
2) Allow the user to see differences among multiple editions of this songbook.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As one might imagine, this songbook includes both musical notation and text. Currently, the images are (I believe) PDFs.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm thinking this sounds Juxta-ish, but can Juxta be deployed on the Web? What would you do? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm (seemingly perpetually) in the early stages of a critical edition of a Latin text and am looking for advice on the best tools to organize the work of transcription. There's only one of me, so I don't need something specifically geared towards crowd-sourcing. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some particulars:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;– I have about 20 full or partial manuscripts of a text of approximately 17,000 words.&#60;br /&#62;
– I don't especially want to fully automate the collation process once I've transcribed all the mss, but I WOULD like to be able to quickly pull the transcriptions of a particular passage for two or more mss, or query my transcriptions for particular lemmata to look for agreement or disagreement. I'd love something that makes &#34;manual&#34; collation very accessible visually - that is, something that will produce literally a synopsis of readings.&#60;br /&#62;
– If there's a tool that would easily accommodate making discursive notes to myself as I transcribe, that would be fab.&#60;br /&#62;
– I expect this project to have at least two distinct end-products, one a traditional (i.e, paper) critical edition, and one an electronic, single-manuscript edition from the earliest witness. My main concern at the transcription phase is not to do anything that would close off the possibility of either kind of output.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So I guess I really have two questions:&#60;br /&#62;
1) Is there software that will help with logistical and visual organization, and...&#60;br /&#62;
2) To what extent should I be thinking about coding at the transcription stage? That is, presumably I'd need to add some very basic coding to make the text query-able in the way I'm envisioning, but there are lots of features of the text that won't be meaningfully encodable until I've established the text...and here I get lost in a hermeneutic circle.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any suggestions for tools and/or help thinking through this would be gratefully received.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Carin

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've often found myself wondering if anybody has written a book-length narrative history telling the story of humanities computing/digital humanities from the early days of humanities computing until now (or some approximation thereof), addressing major milestone DH projects, related efforts, and some of the big themes of the field as they've evolved--or haven't--over time?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I suspect that some histories may have been done that address particular disciplines (e.g. digital history), but have they been tied together and examined as a whole?  I see that the question has been addressed in conference presentations, such as those by &#60;a href=&#34;http://infomotions.com/blog/tag/digital-humanities/&#34;&#62;Joe Raben&#60;/a&#62; or &#60;a href=&#34;http://infomotions.com/blog/2010/05/cyberinfrastructure-days-at-the-university-of-notre-dame/&#34;&#62;Stéfan Sinclair&#60;/a&#62;, and appears in Chapter 1 of Schreibman et al.'s &#34;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/&#34;&#62;A Companion to Digital Humanities&#60;/a&#62;,&#34; but I wondered if anything longer has been published.  I may well have just sailed right past it.  Seems like it would make a great oral history project, too.
