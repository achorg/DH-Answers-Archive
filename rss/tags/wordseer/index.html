			<description>&#60;p&#62;This question is really fascinating (especially since I suspect I have inkling of &#60;a href=&#34;http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/&#34;&#62;the sort of texts&#60;/a&#62; you're interested in). Let me just dump a handful of links which I think might be helpful from my recent delicious/pinboard (hmm... delicious pinboard).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While I can't point to specific results/papers. Aditi Muralidharan (@silverasm)'s WordSeer project is promising interesting results about slave narratives, though it does not rely on TEI. In &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aditi/projects/wordseer.html&#34;&#62;this talk&#60;/a&#62;, though, she does a good job of answering Sean's question directly--how can metadata improve on generic full-text search. WordSeer (as I understand it) works mostly by supplementing raw text with part of speech tagging and other grammatical metadata.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With respect to TEI specifically one obvious place to start, I think, is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.monkproject.org/&#34;&#62;MONK&#60;/a&#62;; as Dorothea notes, Martin Mueller is involved with the MONK project. You can find him summarizing MONK &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cocoon/tei2008/programme/abstracts/abstract-169.html&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62; and at greater length &#60;a href=&#34;https://apps.lis.illinois.edu/wiki/display/MONK/Notes+towards+a+user+manual+of+Monk&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;. Unlike WordSeer, the Monk Workbench gives you metadata about author (including gender) and publication date. Matt Kirschenbaum mentions MONK in &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~hillol/NGDM07/abstracts/talks/MKirschenbaum.pdf&#34;&#62;this article&#60;/a&#62; [PDF].&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(How relevant it will be to you, I don't know, but when I heard John Unsworth speak recently, he talked about the work flow and complications of large text collections with different encoding standards--with reference to MONK in particular. You can hear him &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.scholarslab.org/podcasts/unsworth-idiosyncrasy-at-scale/&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There was a &#60;a href=&#34;http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1104&#38;amp;L=TEI-L&#38;amp;F=&#38;amp;S=&#38;amp;O=T&#38;amp;H=0&#38;amp;D=0&#38;amp;T=1#34&#34;&#62;recent discussion&#60;/a&#62; on the TEI list about eXist from which I learned a lot--again, about what's possible rather than specific results/reports.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Finally--this one is also not TEI specific--if you haven't seen Ben Schmidt's blog, he is doing some pretty impressive stuff. This post, on &#60;a href=&#34;http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/04/age-cohort-and-vocabulary-use.html&#34;&#62;vocabulary use and age cohort&#60;/a&#62; gives some idea.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I might sharpen the question further by trying to differentiate between texts that have digitally archived and those have been marked-up using the TEI standards.  That is, what kind of discoveries or scholarly innovations has the tagging process itself helped to create that wouldn't have been accessible to more generic full-text searching and/or processing?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;People to start with here would certainly include Martin Muller. The &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.nines.org/publications&#34;&#62;NINES project&#60;/a&#62; may also be a fruitful source.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I suggest, actually, that you dig up some TEI-encoded corpora and trace them through the literature. Offhand, the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.umich.edu/tcp/&#34;&#62;Text Creation Partnership&#60;/a&#62; and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.wwp.brown.edu/&#34;&#62;Brown Women Writer's Project&#60;/a&#62; should have spawned a fair amount of scholarship by now.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello, DHers,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm writing a report on the TEI in literature, and I'm looking for &#34;discoveries&#34; made in your research using TEI-encoded texts. We've heard of research in the popular press utilizing Google's n-grams, as well as other &#34;text only&#34; archives. I'm looking for research/discoveries accomplished using the TEI standard specifically. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you've made such a discovery, what was it, and what program did you use/create in the making of said discovery? Was this research published? If not, why? If so, where did you publish? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you for your input!&#60;br /&#62;
M.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
