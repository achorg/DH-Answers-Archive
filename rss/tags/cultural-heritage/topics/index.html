			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have the opportunity to develop a proposal to work with Brown's visualization group - supercomputers, a CAVE for 3-D presentation, great computer imaging possibilities. I've come up with schemes involving presentation of artifacts and landscapes... but I'm sure there are other possibilities, either that someone's tried, or someone has considered trying. What's the state of the field, the most interesting work so far? What needs more research?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hey folks,&#60;br /&#62;
In response to some recent discussions about access to information about digital humanities from folks working in the cultural heritage sector, I decided to provide a quick start guide for those interested in finding more information about things digital that might relate to cultural heritage.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This list is only meant to be a starting point, and in no way final, definitive, or proscriptive. I am cross-posting this to DH Answers so that it can grow there in a forum setting and be more open. (If interested, you can read &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfortynine.org/2011/01/navigating-dh-for-cultural-heritage-professionals/&#34;&#62; &#60;/a&#62;)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Please add &#60;/strong&#62; to this and pass this around to your colleagues who do not follow DH'ers.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Find a &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org/&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Join a Museum Tech Association&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mcn.edu/&#34;&#62;Museum Computer Network&#60;/a&#62; is a friendly association of GLAM and DH professionals. MCN sponsors a listserv, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mcn.edu/mcn-l&#34;&#62;MCN-L&#60;/a&#62;, and its website provides a number of good resources available to anyone.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;American Association of Museum's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/&#34;&#62;Media and Technology standing professional committee&#60;/a&#62;: This SPG sponsors tech-related sessions at AAM and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/muse/index.html&#34;&#62;MUSE awards&#60;/a&#62; that highlight exemplar uses of technology in museum galleries and in digital formats.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Attend technology-focused sessions at GLAM conferences&#60;br /&#62;
If you are not working in your institution's tech department, you can still attend sessions at a LAM conference. More tech-focused sessions are available at regional museum association meetings and professional conferences, and sometimes there are some strategy sessions that offer project management assistance or advise for choosing appropriate tools for specific projects.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digital-jumpstart.org/index.php/Topics&#34;&#62; Digital-JumpStart&#60;/a&#62;: sessions from NCPH and AAM 2010, offered opportunities for individuals to to benefit from the lessons learned by those more experienced in the field, and left a legacy with a wiki of resources on all kinds of GLAM-related topics.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.imls.gov/about/webwise.shtm&#34;&#62;Webwise&#60;/a&#62;: sponsored by the Institute for Museum and Library Services where representatives&#60;br /&#62;
of museums, libraries, archives, systems science, education, and&#60;br /&#62;
other fields interested in the future of online content for inquiry and learning. Conference is free.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://archimuse.com/conferences/mw.html&#34;&#62;Museums and the Web&#60;/a&#62;: Not everyone can afford to attend Museums and the Web, or may feel that they are not tech-savvy enough to attend, but you can read most papers presented at the conference online for free.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Review Award-winning Museum Media/Technology Projects&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/muse/index.html&#34;&#62;MUSE Awards&#60;/a&#62;, sponsored by AAM's Media and Technology Committee.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://conference.archimuse.com/page/best_web_awards&#34;&#62;Best of the Web&#60;/a&#62;, sponsored by Archimuse and the Museums and the Web community&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Subscribe to Blogs&#60;br /&#62;
There are too many good blogs for me to list here, but I will recommend a few that can help you get started.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://musematic.net/&#34;&#62;Musematic&#60;/a&#62;: Written by members of AAM's Media and Technology standing professional committee.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.technologyinthearts.org/&#34;&#62;Technology in the Arts&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;/a&#62;written by Carnegie Mellon University's Center for Arts Management and Technology.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/&#34;&#62;Digital Humanities Now&#60;/a&#62; created by Dan Cohen and Jeremy Boggs at the&#60;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu&#34;&#62; Center for History and New Media&#60;/a&#62;, is a real-time, crowdsourced publication. If you don't use Twitter, this helps pull out what people are talking about by taking the pulse of the digital humanities community and tries to discern what articles, blog posts, projects, tools, collections, and announcements are worthy of greater attention.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Participate in Online Forums&#60;br /&#62;
Most technology projects host forums for help questions (ie, &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/forums&#34;&#62;Omeka&#60;/a&#62;), but there are also some general forums that can be very helpful too.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers&#34;&#62;DH Answers&#60;/a&#62; is building a community-based Q&#38;amp;A board for digital humanities questions that need a longer answer than Twitter provides.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Experiment with Digital Tools&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://digitalresearchtools.pbworks.com/w/page/17801672/FrontPage&#34;&#62;Digital Research Tools wiki (DiRT)&#60;/a&#62;: DiRT is a good starting place for browsing summaries and reviews of scores of digital tools for you to play with or think about trying for a new project.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Take a Webinar&#60;br /&#62;
Some webinars are free, others are not. They all offer training and varying levels of interaction that occur at your desktop and do not require travel.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.oclc.org/research/events/taichi.htm&#34;&#62;OCLC TAI CHI&#60;/a&#62; series highlights innovative applications that libraries, museums and archives may find effective in their own environments, and teaches new technologies and skills.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;AAM offers a variety of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.aam-us.org/getinvolved/learn/ondemandwebinars.cfm&#34;&#62;professional development through webinars&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Participate on Twitter&#60;br /&#62;
Getting started on Twitter may seem overwhelming and may not be practical given your daily responsibilities at your institution. If you're interested in following some folks before participating yourself, here are a few lists to get you going. (Not sure &#60;a href=&#34;http://digital-jumpstart.org/index.php/Social_Media&#34;&#62;how to get started on Twitter&#60;/a&#62;?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/danamuses/new-media-in-museums&#34;&#62;New Media in Museums&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/dancohen/digitalhumanities&#34;&#62;Digital Humanities list for DH Now &#34;editors&#34;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62; Create your own list of favorite museum tweeters&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
