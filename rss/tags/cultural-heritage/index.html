			<description>&#60;p&#62;Here is my provisional list of the ways visualization could be used in the digital humanities. Could DHers suggest more to add to this list, and/or better categories?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;~ For language-based research: text mapping, word trees and clouds, and phrase nets (all for text analysis); scatterplots (for historical usage); databases (of texts and metadata).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;~ For spatial/temporal research: timelines and historical maps (both with animations, embedded documents, and other related information); &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;~ For performance/fine arts research: simulations and animations of performances.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Maureen Stone's essay &#34;Information Visualization: Challenge for the Humanities&#34; in this CLIR / NEH report (2009) is worth reading:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub145abst.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub145abst.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I like that it addresses questions of information literacy more broadly.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hey folks,&#60;br /&#62;
In response to some recent discussions about access to information about digital humanities from folks working in the cultural heritage sector, I decided to provide a quick start guide for those interested in finding more information about things digital that might relate to cultural heritage.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This list is only meant to be a starting point, and in no way final, definitive, or proscriptive. I am cross-posting this to DH Answers so that it can grow there in a forum setting and be more open. (If interested, you can read &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfortynine.org/2011/01/navigating-dh-for-cultural-heritage-professionals/&#34;&#62; &#60;/a&#62;)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Please add &#60;/strong&#62; to this and pass this around to your colleagues who do not follow DH'ers.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Find a &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org/&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Join a Museum Tech Association&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mcn.edu/&#34;&#62;Museum Computer Network&#60;/a&#62; is a friendly association of GLAM and DH professionals. MCN sponsors a listserv, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mcn.edu/mcn-l&#34;&#62;MCN-L&#60;/a&#62;, and its website provides a number of good resources available to anyone.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;American Association of Museum's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/&#34;&#62;Media and Technology standing professional committee&#60;/a&#62;: This SPG sponsors tech-related sessions at AAM and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/muse/index.html&#34;&#62;MUSE awards&#60;/a&#62; that highlight exemplar uses of technology in museum galleries and in digital formats.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Attend technology-focused sessions at GLAM conferences&#60;br /&#62;
If you are not working in your institution's tech department, you can still attend sessions at a LAM conference. More tech-focused sessions are available at regional museum association meetings and professional conferences, and sometimes there are some strategy sessions that offer project management assistance or advise for choosing appropriate tools for specific projects.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digital-jumpstart.org/index.php/Topics&#34;&#62; Digital-JumpStart&#60;/a&#62;: sessions from NCPH and AAM 2010, offered opportunities for individuals to to benefit from the lessons learned by those more experienced in the field, and left a legacy with a wiki of resources on all kinds of GLAM-related topics.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.imls.gov/about/webwise.shtm&#34;&#62;Webwise&#60;/a&#62;: sponsored by the Institute for Museum and Library Services where representatives&#60;br /&#62;
of museums, libraries, archives, systems science, education, and&#60;br /&#62;
other fields interested in the future of online content for inquiry and learning. Conference is free.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://archimuse.com/conferences/mw.html&#34;&#62;Museums and the Web&#60;/a&#62;: Not everyone can afford to attend Museums and the Web, or may feel that they are not tech-savvy enough to attend, but you can read most papers presented at the conference online for free.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Review Award-winning Museum Media/Technology Projects&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/muse/index.html&#34;&#62;MUSE Awards&#60;/a&#62;, sponsored by AAM's Media and Technology Committee.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://conference.archimuse.com/page/best_web_awards&#34;&#62;Best of the Web&#60;/a&#62;, sponsored by Archimuse and the Museums and the Web community&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Subscribe to Blogs&#60;br /&#62;
There are too many good blogs for me to list here, but I will recommend a few that can help you get started.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://musematic.net/&#34;&#62;Musematic&#60;/a&#62;: Written by members of AAM's Media and Technology standing professional committee.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.technologyinthearts.org/&#34;&#62;Technology in the Arts&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;/a&#62;written by Carnegie Mellon University's Center for Arts Management and Technology.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/&#34;&#62;Digital Humanities Now&#60;/a&#62; created by Dan Cohen and Jeremy Boggs at the&#60;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu&#34;&#62; Center for History and New Media&#60;/a&#62;, is a real-time, crowdsourced publication. If you don't use Twitter, this helps pull out what people are talking about by taking the pulse of the digital humanities community and tries to discern what articles, blog posts, projects, tools, collections, and announcements are worthy of greater attention.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Participate in Online Forums&#60;br /&#62;
Most technology projects host forums for help questions (ie, &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/forums&#34;&#62;Omeka&#60;/a&#62;), but there are also some general forums that can be very helpful too.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers&#34;&#62;DH Answers&#60;/a&#62; is building a community-based Q&#38;amp;A board for digital humanities questions that need a longer answer than Twitter provides.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Experiment with Digital Tools&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://digitalresearchtools.pbworks.com/w/page/17801672/FrontPage&#34;&#62;Digital Research Tools wiki (DiRT)&#60;/a&#62;: DiRT is a good starting place for browsing summaries and reviews of scores of digital tools for you to play with or think about trying for a new project.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Take a Webinar&#60;br /&#62;
Some webinars are free, others are not. They all offer training and varying levels of interaction that occur at your desktop and do not require travel.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.oclc.org/research/events/taichi.htm&#34;&#62;OCLC TAI CHI&#60;/a&#62; series highlights innovative applications that libraries, museums and archives may find effective in their own environments, and teaches new technologies and skills.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;AAM offers a variety of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.aam-us.org/getinvolved/learn/ondemandwebinars.cfm&#34;&#62;professional development through webinars&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Participate on Twitter&#60;br /&#62;
Getting started on Twitter may seem overwhelming and may not be practical given your daily responsibilities at your institution. If you're interested in following some folks before participating yourself, here are a few lists to get you going. (Not sure &#60;a href=&#34;http://digital-jumpstart.org/index.php/Social_Media&#34;&#62;how to get started on Twitter&#60;/a&#62;?)&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm cooking up a project here at Carleton to use the web.alive platform from Avaya &#60;a href=&#34;http://http://avayalive.com/WaStore/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://http://avayalive.com/WaStore/&#60;/a&#62; (which uses the Unreal engine) to recreate the layers &#38;amp; contexts from a small scale training excavation, as a tool for demonstrating how archaeological knowledge is created. The idea being that be engaging with actual manipulable objects, deeper learning is created.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm also working with agent based modeling &#38;amp; simulation, using the netlogo environment &#60;a href=&#34;http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/4.1.1/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/4.1.1/&#60;/a&#62; . Models I've built live at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.graeworks.net/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.graeworks.net/&#60;/a&#62; .  You could use Netlogo to prototype a simulation, and then scale up with the supercomputer... On the GIS and Agent Based Modeling blog, they also describe some experiments in marrying the two together (3d immersive worlds where you interact with artificially intelligent agents) &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.gisagents.blogspot.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.gisagents.blogspot.com/&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There are a variety of things you can do with 3D visualization.  I have worked on several cultural heritage reconstruction projects, most recently two Roman houses, the House of the Faun in Pompeii and the House of the Drinking Contest from the port city of Antioch.  Both models recontextualize the artwork in the houses by placing high-resolution images of mosaics into the appropriate spaces and calibrating the model to the latitude and longitude of the site in order to accurately simulate the sunlight at a particular minute in history.  This is especially useful for observing the way light interacts with artwork, architecture, and people, especially during social situations like formal dinners (example: &#60;a href=&#34;http://people.virginia.edu/~ewg4x/hotdc/caa-hdc-medium.mov)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://people.virginia.edu/~ewg4x/hotdc/caa-hdc-medium.mov)&#60;/a&#62;.  The lighting simulation methodology can be applied to more than just these two projects, but to any site reconstruction.  Candlelight can also be simulated.  Applying accurate lighting to a reconstruction enables one to pose scholarly questions that otherwise never would have been considered.  The next step is to bring the House of the Drinking Contest into a 3D game engine, Unity.  Unity is becoming the standard engine for cultural heritage reconstructions.  It is powerful and free for non-commercial purposes.  Once the model is in Unity, the museums that now own the mosaics that were once in the house will be able to use the model for demonstration purposes to patrons.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've also worked a bit with landscapes.  Last year, I created a model of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and the Austrian Archaeological Institute (who excavates Ephesus) graciously provided me with GIS terrain data for the square kilometer in which the temple resides.  This terrain included a large mountain to the southwest.  I converted this terrain data into a 3D model that I imported into my project, and with lighting simulation, was able to recreate the landscape more realistically, observing when the temple fell into the shadow of the mountain.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for artifacts, there are a wide variety of 3D scanning projects out there.  Depending on the type of artifact, you may not need to create 3D models to observe the three-dimensionality of the object.  Polynomial texture mapping may be of use for objects that are somewhat flat, like coins or illuminated manuscripts (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/ptm/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/ptm/&#60;/a&#62;)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Steve -- I would definitely check out the Virtual Vault project.  It is a collaboration between the Arizona State Museum and the Center for Desert Archaeology to create this amazing virtual version of their huge collection of southwestern pottery.  They are using low-cost technology to create 3-D images of their collection.  It enables both museum visitors and researchers to virtually &#34;handle&#34; the pottery that, in real life, is too fragile for you to touch.  We helped fund it via a Start Up Grant.  I saw Doug Gann from UArizona demonstrate it at the museum and it was really terrific.  Doug is also experimenting with putting the virtual images in CAVEs and the like so you can compare them to each other over time.  Here's an article with links:&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've also replied to your Twitter query, but I'll pass along the same information.  The NEH Office of Digital Humanities has put together a Humanities High Performance Supercomputing Resource Page that you might find useful.  The page may be found at &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/fVPSI&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/fVPSI&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There were three recipients of the special NEH/Department of Energy Humanities High Performance Computing program.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;o   The Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University for its project Large-Scale Learning and the Automatic Analysis of Historical Texts.  The Perseus project will be using advanced computational linguistic technologies to experiment with the analysis of ancient texts for the study of classics and other fields. Additional information may be found at &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/fVSeM&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/fVSeM&#60;/a&#62; .&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;o   The University of California, San Diego for its project Visualizing Patterns in Databases of Cultural Images and Video.  UC San Diego will be creating computerized visualizations of large databases of digitized cultural heritage materials and performing statistical analyses on the data to discover new ways of studying art and culture. Additional information may be found at &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/fVS8Q&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/fVS8Q&#60;/a&#62; .&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;o  The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia for its project High Performance Computing for Processing and Analysis of Digitized 3-D Models of Cultural Heritage.   IATH will process previously-acquired raw datasets of culturally valuable objects such as artistic statuary, archaeological artifacts, and historical architecture in order to create highly accurate 3-D models for the study of art and architecture. Additional information at &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/fVQhC&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/fVQhC&#60;/a&#62; .  David Koller, the PI, has also received a Digital Humanities Start Up Grant to continue work on his project.  More information on this project at &#60;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/fVS1m&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://is.gd/fVS1m&#60;/a&#62; .

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Steve, knowing your work and role at Brown, I suspect you're thinking specifically in the cultural heritage / museums realm -- but correct me if I'm wrong.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Richard Levy presented a great (and image-rich) paper at the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.playingwithhistory.com/&#34;&#62;Playing with Technology in History&#60;/a&#62; symposium, “3-D Interactive Worlds as Educational Tools for Understanding Arctic Life.”  I'm reproducing the abstract below, and the paper's available in draft form &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.playingwithhistory.com/abstracts/&#34;&#62;on the site&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I liked it, personally, because it was about affective and subjective response -- not about the kinds of big-data or analytical verisimilitude projects we so often hear about with regard to supercomputing and viz.  (Since I imagine you'll get a bunch of responses about those possibilities -- &#60;a href=&#34;http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/~dk/&#34;&#62;work like David Koller's&#60;/a&#62; -- I thought I'd toss this one in at the outset!)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;Richard Levy: This paper explores how interactive 3-D worlds and computer modeling can be used to excite interest in traditional dwellings constructed by indigenous groups in the Canadian High Arctic. This paper explores the degree to which digital replicas of objects, houses and simulations can be used to support the study of Arctic history in interactive worlds. Also examined is the idea that virtual worlds can to evoke emotive, effectual knowledge in indigenous users. The discussion will be based on our experience with primary school and college students, and Padleirmiut Inuit Elders who experienced digital reconstructions of Inuit dwellings in a 3D virtual theater (CAVE) at the University of Calgary. Results suggest that virtual heritage environments may be useful in initiating and establishing discourses in archaeological interpretation, as well as assisting personal identity recovery.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/blockquote&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have the opportunity to develop a proposal to work with Brown's visualization group - supercomputers, a CAVE for 3-D presentation, great computer imaging possibilities. I've come up with schemes involving presentation of artifacts and landscapes... but I'm sure there are other possibilities, either that someone's tried, or someone has considered trying. What's the state of the field, the most interesting work so far? What needs more research?
