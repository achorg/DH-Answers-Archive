			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am looking for software that will display digital images files of handwritten material on the same screen as workspace for creating transcriptions of that material, preferably in a collaboration context.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm (seemingly perpetually) in the early stages of a critical edition of a Latin text and am looking for advice on the best tools to organize the work of transcription. There's only one of me, so I don't need something specifically geared towards crowd-sourcing. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some particulars:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;– I have about 20 full or partial manuscripts of a text of approximately 17,000 words.&#60;br /&#62;
– I don't especially want to fully automate the collation process once I've transcribed all the mss, but I WOULD like to be able to quickly pull the transcriptions of a particular passage for two or more mss, or query my transcriptions for particular lemmata to look for agreement or disagreement. I'd love something that makes &#34;manual&#34; collation very accessible visually - that is, something that will produce literally a synopsis of readings.&#60;br /&#62;
– If there's a tool that would easily accommodate making discursive notes to myself as I transcribe, that would be fab.&#60;br /&#62;
– I expect this project to have at least two distinct end-products, one a traditional (i.e, paper) critical edition, and one an electronic, single-manuscript edition from the earliest witness. My main concern at the transcription phase is not to do anything that would close off the possibility of either kind of output.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So I guess I really have two questions:&#60;br /&#62;
1) Is there software that will help with logistical and visual organization, and...&#60;br /&#62;
2) To what extent should I be thinking about coding at the transcription stage? That is, presumably I'd need to add some very basic coding to make the text query-able in the way I'm envisioning, but there are lots of features of the text that won't be meaningfully encodable until I've established the text...and here I get lost in a hermeneutic circle.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any suggestions for tools and/or help thinking through this would be gratefully received.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Carin

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Looking for software to do audio transcription of linguistic interviews. The ideal package will be able to synch audio and transcript, export output in some sanely archivable form, be installed/used by relatively non-technical users, and do a little light audio editing (mostly to cut out bits that could threaten someone's privacy).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What's out there?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
