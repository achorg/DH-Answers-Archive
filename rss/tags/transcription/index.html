&#60;p&#62;It's worth mentioning that Scripto itself is CMS-neutral (See &#60;a href='http://scripto.org/documentation/about/'&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;). Developers can build their own tools to make it talk with whatever CMS they want. So far, they've built the connectors for Omeka, WP, and Drupal, but more would be awesome.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not sure about Scripto to record TEI, though, since the transcriptions are recorded in MediaWiki.

&#60;p&#62;These are excellent questions, Ethan.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding image importing, at the moment the only transcription tools I know of supporting any sort of integration with external images are Scripto (Omeka, Wordpress, Drupal), FromThePage (Internet Archive), Islandora TEI Editor (Fedora), the (closed-source) BYU Historic Journals project (ContentDM), and Zooniverse Scribe (via deep-linking to any image on the internet, at a per-page level).  This is, in my opinion, a serious and non-trivial problem with all transcription tools -- just last week I talked with a librarian who really wanted to use T-PEN for medieval manuscript fragments, but was going to use Scripto instead, purely because the images were on their Omeka site.  It seems like rather than using the right tool for the job--and my own FromThePage would be just as inappropriate as Scripto for this use--she was using the tool which integrated with her CMS.  The problem is that it's a lot of effort to integrate tool X with CMS Y, and it's not a problem that scales well across either dimension.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not aware of any transcription tools that do linked data at all.  I know that I've looked into it for FromThePage, but those investigations remain just that -- exciting ideas which do not override improvements to the core tool.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regarding exports, the XML-(or TEI)-native T-PEN and Bentham Transcription Desk should support export of whatever TEI you use to put into them.  Ditto for MOM-CA-based tools like Itinera Nova, Monasterium, Virtuelles deutsches Urkundennetzwerk as well as the Papyrological Editor.  Mind you &#34;should&#34; is my own term -- I don't know if any of these tools actually feature an 'export' button or API.  FromThePage converts transcripts, subjects, indices, and edit histories into one big HTML file for export, with classes which may allow extraction and conversion.  (I explored TEI export in 2009, but at the time had no background in TEI and abandoned the project -- things will be different soon, however.)  I gather that Scripto exports to the CMS which is its database-of-record, and suspect that CrowdCrafting may well have an export feature as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I love your idea of combining annotation and open data -- it seems to come up all the time in conversation these days, but I don't know of any projects which have gotten beyond the idea stage.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sorry, to dredge up an old topic, but are any of the tools listed here capable of importing images from or otherwise interacting with DSpace? FromThePage appears to support some of the annotations that I would like to make about manuscript images, but I want to avoid making duplicates of images, if possible (since various derivatives will already be available in DSpace, should I elect to use it).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also, is anyone aware of annotation tools that interact with web services, such as linking manuscripts to resources defined in VIAF or Geonames?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What sorts of export mechanisms are provided by these annotation tools?  Can I export to TEI?  MODS?  Something else?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I envision using an annotation tool in the back-end to generate TEI or some other robust form of metadata with links to thesauri like VIAF, Geonames, or the Pleiades Gazetteer of Ancient Places in order to import a lot of open data for enhanced context, generate maps, etc.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The conversion of files from audio to word format is a common need in the market. The complexity of conversion is increasing more with the technological advancement and introduction of the digital media. This technology has led to increase in the requirements when doing transcription. Professionals such as busy executives and lawyers now want their presentations transcribed accurately for future use. So using manual transcription services like &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.transcriptionwave.com&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.transcriptionwave.com&#60;/a&#62; yield 98.5%, compared to automatic software.

&#60;p&#62;Alex, thanks for this, especially the suggestion of using place-holding markers. That helps a lot!&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm not pretty sure I understand exactly what you are looking for in the original question, but let me try to share some thoughts:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;a) Juxta is indeed a good tool to have. As you've noticed it has evolved and can now read TEI. I don't know what are your mark-up practices, but the ability to only compare the tags that you choose might be what you are looking for when you talk about comparing specific lemmata. Juxta is also still in continuous development, so stay tuned. I foresee Juxta giving back the editor even more control over what to collate and what not collate.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;b) I don't recommend tagging from the beginning, since once the transcription is done, with some of the software we have out there it is easy to &#34;wrap&#34; blocks of text with the tags you need. You do want to leave markers for yourself as you go along, though. For example, if I'm transcribing prose, I leave myself a simple paragraph break marker, /p, as I go along. Notice that actual characters of your markers don't need to be proper XML or HTML or what have you. They just need to be easy to type, unique things that you can Find and Replace when it comes time to marking-up. In this case, after I am done I do a find and replace that looks something like this: Find: &#60;code&#62;/p&#60;/code&#62; ; Replace with: &#60;code&#62;&#38;lt;/p&#38;gt;&#38;lt;p&#38;gt;&#60;/code&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;c) Have you heard of &#60;a href=&#34;http://scripto.org/&#34;&#62;Scripto?&#60;/a&#62; Perhaps this would move things faster for you.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Thanks, Rachel. I'd looked at Juxta before, but not for a couple of years. It looks like it's evolved a lot, so I'll definitely check it out.&#60;/p&#62;

&#60;p&#62;Juxta comes to mind as a possibility: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.juxtasoftware.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.juxtasoftware.org/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've only played around with it a little bit, but it might be the kind of tool you're looking for, in terms of visualizing collations. The necessary XML markup looks pretty minimal as well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Speaking of XML, if you're not already familiar with TEI's documentation about encoding MSS, that might be a good starting point: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm a project assistant with the William Blake Archive (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/)&#60;/a&#62;. I recently published an article about encoding Blake's manuscript in XML -- including some discussion of how we developed the tag set (which is based on TEI, but not strictly TEI-compliant). It might be useful as you consider the encoding standards for your MSS? Here it is: &#60;a href=&#34;http://romantic.arhu.umd.edu/praxis/editing_blake/lee_mcghee/lee_mcghee.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://romantic.arhu.umd.edu/praxis/editing_blake/lee_mcghee/lee_mcghee.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Hope any of this is useful!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Rachel

&#60;p&#62;Thanks, Shane. I definitely need to wrap my mind around version control, and I'd missed Julie's article. I also just found this, which looks like it might be helpful in comparing options: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/09/18/the-top-7-open-source-version-control-systems/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/09/18/the-top-7-open-source-version-control-systems/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm not a classicist, but my sense is that the tools developed by Greg Crane and his associates at the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/&#34;&#62;Perseus Project&#60;/a&#62;  might be one option.  If nothing else, investigating how they've solved some of these problems might give you ideas for your own work.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62; As for question number two,  one option is to store your transcriptions in a text-based format that can easily be put into a version control system. Julie Meloni's &#60;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/a-gentle-introduction-to-version-control/23064&#34;&#62;A Gentle Introduction to Version Control&#60;/a&#62;  may be helpful for understanding this. The advantage of version control, other than making it easier for  you to undo changes, is that every time you save an edited version of a particular text, you can comment about what precisely you changed ( or, for example, what tags  you used in this round of encoding.)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm (seemingly perpetually) in the early stages of a critical edition of a Latin text and am looking for advice on the best tools to organize the work of transcription. There's only one of me, so I don't need something specifically geared towards crowd-sourcing. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some particulars:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;– I have about 20 full or partial manuscripts of a text of approximately 17,000 words.&#60;br /&#62;
– I don't especially want to fully automate the collation process once I've transcribed all the mss, but I WOULD like to be able to quickly pull the transcriptions of a particular passage for two or more mss, or query my transcriptions for particular lemmata to look for agreement or disagreement. I'd love something that makes &#34;manual&#34; collation very accessible visually - that is, something that will produce literally a synopsis of readings.&#60;br /&#62;
– If there's a tool that would easily accommodate making discursive notes to myself as I transcribe, that would be fab.&#60;br /&#62;
– I expect this project to have at least two distinct end-products, one a traditional (i.e, paper) critical edition, and one an electronic, single-manuscript edition from the earliest witness. My main concern at the transcription phase is not to do anything that would close off the possibility of either kind of output.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So I guess I really have two questions:&#60;br /&#62;
1) Is there software that will help with logistical and visual organization, and...&#60;br /&#62;
2) To what extent should I be thinking about coding at the transcription stage? That is, presumably I'd need to add some very basic coding to make the text query-able in the way I'm envisioning, but there are lots of features of the text that won't be meaningfully encodable until I've established the text...and here I get lost in a hermeneutic circle.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any suggestions for tools and/or help thinking through this would be gratefully received.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Carin

			<description>&#60;p&#62;TILE by itself wouldn't really help with this, but it's designed to be incorporated into other systems (VRE, for example) - and we're hopeful that once it's released this year it will actually be used in that way. And this may sound naive, but what about just using a wiki? Could you format the pages so that the images are on the left and you can transcribe on the right, or something? Otherwise, I'd second T-Pen and Transcribe Bentham (the advantage of TB being that it's actually going to be available soon).
