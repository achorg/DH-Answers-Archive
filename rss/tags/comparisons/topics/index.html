			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working with a faculty member who has translated 2 16th century books from Latin to English and has extensively annotated them. Both are lightly TEI encoded and could be more heavily encoded as needed. He would like to display the original and the translation side by side. A page-by-page display, as opposed to a line-by-line display, would be sufficient. When he originally asked for advice a couple years ago I looked at Juxta and the Versioning Machine. Anything new since then that I should look at? He is not looking for witness comparisons, heat maps, or anything too sophisticated. A flip-book view (one page of Latin next to one page of English) would be ideal in terms of what he is visualizing.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;- Hope
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm trying to help a scholar who'd like to create a website that can do two things:&#60;br /&#62;
1) Display a digitized songbook; and&#60;br /&#62;
2) Allow the user to see differences among multiple editions of this songbook.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As one might imagine, this songbook includes both musical notation and text. Currently, the images are (I believe) PDFs.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm thinking this sounds Juxta-ish, but can Juxta be deployed on the Web? What would you do? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
