			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello,&#60;br /&#62;
This is my first post, I will try to be concise. I was very glad to find this page.&#60;br /&#62;
I am looking for a good master's program to study digital humanities in the US. I am currently residing in Romania.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have found it far more difficult than I had thought, to find these master's online. The only ones I've been able to locate are one at MIT and at the University of Maryland. I imagine there must be more...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would very much appreciate your help in finding some.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Marius Lobontiu

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working with a group at UNC-Chapel Hill on DH-related educational initiatives and we're pulling together an environmental scan of graduate level digital humanities programs--PhD, MA, certificates. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Past posts on DH Q&#38;amp;A have been great at pointing me toward established programs, but now I'm wondering if there are other graduate level programs in the works? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd also be interested in hearing about programs that allow humanities PhD students to substitute tech skills, research methodologies, etc. for foreign languages requirements as well as PhD programs that incorporate DH training in other ways---perhaps as a minor field, etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Cheers,&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It seems to me that maintaining a comprehensive and current list of DH programs should be a high priority for the DH community, especially for outreach to students considering grad and undergrad studies. There's a great summary of &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/DH_Syllabi&#34;&#62;DH syllabi&#60;/a&#62; and a more expansive &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities_education&#34;&#62;Zotero group&#60;/a&#62;, but I'm not sure there's a reliable resource for DH programs (of course, how to define a DH program is a big issue here).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The ALLC's list of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.allc.org/education/seminars-courses&#34;&#62;programs&#60;/a&#62; is very useful. Are there others that are current and fairly complete that you'd recommend?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Where would it make the most sense for such a list to be maintained?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
