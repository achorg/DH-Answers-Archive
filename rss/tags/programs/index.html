			<description>&#60;p&#62;Worth mentioning that there are folders of links to Certificate Programs and Graduate Programs in DH in the group Digital Humanities library on Zotero.org: &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Bump. I notice now this: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalhumanities.ucla.edu/resources/us-dh-academic-programs.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.digitalhumanities.ucla.edu/resources/us-dh-academic-programs.html&#60;/a&#62; . Are there other such lists that have appeared in the interim?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd recommend taking a look at DH education programs like &#60;a href=&#34;http://praxis.scholarslab.org/&#34;&#62;Praxis&#60;/a&#62; at the Scholars' Lab that stand outside of departmental affiliation.  I think this is a better approach than a graduate degree in digital humanities.  Call me old fashioned, but I believe so-called digital humanists should still be trained in traditional research methods.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am a doctoral student at the University of Victoria, and we just approved DH as a Major Field within the English PhD (I just took the comprehensive exam in it). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Various folks (Ray Siemens and some others) are currently developing a graduate certificate, likely tying in with credit for coursework at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, the Oxford Summer School, etc. We're also working on an undergraduate minor, I think, although I'm not sure. I know there is a formal undergraduate program in the works of some sort, but I can't remember the specifics. We currently have a series of four DH-ish undergraduate courses housed within the School of Arts &#38;amp; Humanities (not within any specific department, but as free floating, unattached courses). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A lot of this, at our institution at least, is being driven by graduate student &#38;amp; undergraduate student pressure and what they seem to want.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If any more come to mind, I will pipe up. :)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There's the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ois.ualberta.ca/en/HumanitiesComputing.aspx&#34;&#62;MA at UAlberta&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/courses/mamsc&#34;&#62;MA and PhD at UCL&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Edit: Whoops, you were asking about programs which are in the works. I'm not positive of any, though I think Alberta was working on a PhD.

&#60;p&#62;I suspect you know about King's College already, but just in case, here's the link! They offer both MA and PhD.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working with a group at UNC-Chapel Hill on DH-related educational initiatives and we're pulling together an environmental scan of graduate level digital humanities programs--PhD, MA, certificates. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Past posts on DH Q&#38;amp;A have been great at pointing me toward established programs, but now I'm wondering if there are other graduate level programs in the works? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd also be interested in hearing about programs that allow humanities PhD students to substitute tech skills, research methodologies, etc. for foreign languages requirements as well as PhD programs that incorporate DH training in other ways---perhaps as a minor field, etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Cheers,&#60;br /&#62;
Stephanie

			<description>&#60;p&#62;International in scope, but the project was a little bit abortive, so it's not a very extensive list.  The idea had been to center only on those programs that offered a formal certificate or degree, which seems like what you're thinking, too...

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Good things come to those who wait ‚Äì¬†thanks @&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/profile/gwijthoff'&#62;gwijthoff&#60;/a&#62; for that useful list!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;@&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/profile/nowviskie'&#62;nowviskie&#60;/a&#62;: I think ADHO would be the right place for an international listing of DH programs, though it's not clear to me which branch of the &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/administration&#34;&#62;current structure&#60;/a&#62; might assume this. Another possibility might be &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arts-humanities.net/&#34;&#62;arts-humanities.net&#60;/a&#62;, especially given that they already have an entries-oriented system (great for DH &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.arts-humanities.net/jobs/search/results/taxonomy%3A268&#34;&#62;jobs&#60;/a&#62;, for instance). And of course hosting with the ACH would fit well with other emerging scholar initiatives that it's leading. Why don't I ask around a bit and see if there's a good, sustainable way of moving forward. In the meantime, what's the geographical scope of the MLA's current list?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Last year, the MLA's Committee on Information Technology (which I currently chair) began compiling a list of formal DH certificate programs.  We don't think this is something we should publish and maintain long-term, but we're eager to contribute the information we gathered to a bigger, central list, wherever that might emerge.  (Personally, I think either the &#60;a href=&#34;http://ach.org&#34;&#62;ACH&#60;/a&#62; or &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org&#34;&#62;ADHO&#60;/a&#62; site would be a good home for such a thing -- especially if we set up an easy way for people to suggest additions or emendations.)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi St√©fan.  I have a running list of digital humanities centers, departments, and working groups &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.delicious.com/stacks/view/RXj9oK&#34;&#62;in a Delicious stack&#60;/a&#62;.  Unfortunately the different kinds of groups aren't differentiated, but maybe it will be of some use in setting up a more comprehensive resource.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @St√©fan Sinclair's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/most-comprehensive-and-current-list-of-dh-programs#post-1395&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Good idea, St√©fan. I've collected information about many DH grad &#38;amp; undergrad programs in the Zotero group you mention, but presenting it as a list would be much more coherent and user friendly. I'd be happy to prepare such a list, but I share your question: where would be the best place to post it?  Here? On the ACH, ALLC or ADHO site? On &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/The_CUNY_Digital_Humanities_Resource_Guide&#34;&#62;The CUNY Digital Humanities Resource Guide&#60;/a&#62;? On my blog? Ideally the list would be easy to maintain and update, which suggests a wiki.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It seems to me that maintaining a comprehensive and current list of DH programs should be a high priority for the DH community, especially for outreach to students considering grad and undergrad studies. There's a great summary of &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/DH_Syllabi&#34;&#62;DH syllabi&#60;/a&#62; and a more expansive &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities_education&#34;&#62;Zotero group&#60;/a&#62;, but I'm not sure there's a reliable resource for DH programs (of course, how to define a DH program is a big issue here).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The ALLC's list of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.allc.org/education/seminars-courses&#34;&#62;programs&#60;/a&#62; is very useful. Are there others that are current and fairly complete that you'd recommend?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Where would it make the most sense for such a list to be maintained?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
