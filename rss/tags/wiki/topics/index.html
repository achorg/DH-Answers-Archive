				<title>Miriam Posner on "Best DH project-management system?"</title>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What project-management system does your center or initiative use to monitor progress, set deadlines, keep track of issues, communicate with contributors, set to-do lists, and, well, manage projects as a group?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My impression is that Basecamp is the &#34;industry&#34; standard. If you use it, are there things you wish it did better? DH-specific features you wish it had? Maybe it has too many features?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My experience has been that any number of PM tools work great for a week or two, but if they're not really, really well-integrated into your workflow, they'll sort of drop out of use.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're working on a wiki for our local history, and my dream is to come up with a feature to help sort out mapping questions - if some citation says something was one door south of something else (in 1960) it can be quite difficult to unpack what the address (or general location even) actually was. In my ideal world, each business could have its own article, with a field for the address, and the end result could be a map that would show each article with an address. There are, of course, cases where addresses have changed as buildings have been torn down and rebuilt, split into two, combined, etc., but a map view would seem to make some of that matter less.&#60;br /&#62;
How would I go about this? Is it possible, or am I dreaming? The maps extensions for MediaWiki I've look at seem to be geared toward displaying maps on article pages.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We are at the very start of a project which will populate a relational database with information from archives across the world. There will be three people working on the database and ultimately we want it to be openly available and searchable as an online research tool. Would Microsoft access on sharepoint be a good way of facilitating the collaborative research?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am creating a Wiki for academic collaboration, but I want to make sure that editing of the wiki is only open to a small group of approved users. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What I wasn't able to determine was if I restrict editing privileges whether I can restrict by section of wiki, or just for the whole site?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On a similar topic, if a user is restricted from editing can they still comment on the discussion pages?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
