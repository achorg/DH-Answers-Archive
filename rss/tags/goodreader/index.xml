			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been using GoodReader for a few months and it seems to work well for this sort of thing.  I can bring in PDFs from Dropbox, FTP, box.net, Google Docs, etc. It also has a built-in web browser so I can get to JSTOR, or other repository, and download PDFs of articles fairly directly.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for annotations, I use the highlighting most in GoodReader-- not sure how well it exports to other viewers though.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I haven't used GoodReader, but I do use iAnnotate (based on some recommendations from my Twitter feed), and I find it quite good. It's a breeze to pull in PDFs from Dropbox or from websites. The highlighting and annotations work well, and best of all, they're readable with other PDF viewers.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It's Christmas at my household, which means that I can finally ask this question. I have been using GoodReader on my phone, and I generally like the wide array of means by which one can get to files, the reading experience in general, and the annotation seems a bit clunky, but good enough.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My friend refuses to believe that there is a program for reading scholarly journals, chapters of books, things one has scanned, etc. that is better than iAnnotate.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;How do you all feel? Has anyone tried both? I can't really say money is the issue (since I decided that I apparently *need* FIFA11 on my iPad right after springing for GoodReader), but I would like to avoid getting heavily into the groove on one program or the other on the device and then switching up after succumbing to pressure from my DH peers.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
