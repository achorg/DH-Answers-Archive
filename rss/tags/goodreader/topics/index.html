			<description>&#60;p&#62;It's Christmas at my household, which means that I can finally ask this question. I have been using GoodReader on my phone, and I generally like the wide array of means by which one can get to files, the reading experience in general, and the annotation seems a bit clunky, but good enough.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My friend refuses to believe that there is a program for reading scholarly journals, chapters of books, things one has scanned, etc. that is better than iAnnotate.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;How do you all feel? Has anyone tried both? I can't really say money is the issue (since I decided that I apparently *need* FIFA11 on my iPad right after springing for GoodReader), but I would like to avoid getting heavily into the groove on one program or the other on the device and then switching up after succumbing to pressure from my DH peers.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
