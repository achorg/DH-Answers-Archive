			<description>&#60;p&#62;Something else occurred to me. It's just a small thing but might have a impact down the road depending on your needs. Let's say you're also interested in machine learning, particularly image recognition, where training a model can be computationally taxing. I've noticed that while many toolkits (e.g. Caffe) offer (or even depend) on GPU based optimizations they invariably only support CUDA, which means in effect an nVidia graphics card. However most current Macs and also many older models and of course regular PCs too are sold with video cards from AMD/ATI. So then you'd be stuck or at minimum would need to pony up for another card(s). Consequently, probably a good case could be made for getting one reasonably fast, headless, vanilla PC with lots of RAM and dual video cards to use as a computation server. For example, as mentioned, for machine learning experiments, but also as a place to run MATLAB or Mathematica etc.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Update: A few days later I came across this very useful report on exactly this topic: &#60;a href=&#34;https://timdettmers.wordpress.com/2014/08/14/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://timdettmers.wordpress.com/2014/08/14/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;+ several million for Arno's idea of leaving 25% for experiments and risks. Not only does that reflect the reality of doing DH, and being able to respond to student and faculty needs as they emerge quickly. If the administration is willing to build that in, that's a great signal of their real understanding of and commitment to what a DH lab should be. If you can get that, you'll have a great DH lab!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If the lab is to focus on DH as text analysis then you might want to reconsider buying 6-10 &#34;workstations&#34; (in the sense of high-end PCs) at all. Instead, purchase much cheaper Mini PCs. These will be more than up to the task. Then again, you may not want to deal with creating individual user accounts on these machines or else, cleaning-up the user-directories or working with your IT group to mount shared home directories. I certainly wouldn't.. So If you're really going to be focusing on text anyway, why not do something more radical and purchase a series of ultra cheap Raspberry Pi2s instead., attach these to some big, cheap monitors and give each student a fast 16GB SD card at the start of the class. A learning moment, if you will. The new Raspberry Pi 2 has quad-core CPU, 1GB RAM, runs Ubuntu and even comes bundled with Mathematica v10. It'll be more than capable enough for R, MALLET and the like. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Then, since DH is obviously not just about texts, take some of all the money you've saved and buy just one or two well-equipped PCs or iMacs. Two should be more than enough since you've already got 10 or more MiniPCs or Raspberry Pi computers making up the bulk of the lab. And perhaps, I would not even buy these two workstations, I would lease them on a 3 year replacement cycle. Otherwise, come 3-4-5 years from now, someone is going to have to go back to the Dean or whomever and ask for another one-off capital investment. Instead, if your institution is also kicking in some funding, return (!) some of this capital funding you have now and ask for a raise in your operating budget instead (something most grants will not be able to provide). Alternatively, hold onto some of the money you saved by not purchasing workstations and plan/collaborate with other departments on purchasing various kinds of input devices for use in an experimental setting, such as a portable audio recorder, a basic scanner, a cheap video camera, maybe a portable (GoPro-like) camera or a cheap (even &#34;toy&#34;) 3D scanner. The general idea being that students should not be exposed just to the (comparatively) clean world of texts but also to noisier, dirtier, computationally less tractable &#34;real-world&#34; A/D sources. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Elsewhere on DHAnswers someone made a comment that a lot of time was spent in their DH lab thinking about furniture (tables, table layouts etc). I think this is very good advice. A place in your lab (e.g. a long, tall table) where students can plug-in devices, place their books or tools, carry over a Raspberry Pi, store artifacts, and build and hack at things together in a group would be great, don't you think? Heck, I'd even put it in the center of the room. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Patrick made a very good point in his comment above, &#34;No matter what choices you make, though, you'll be implicitly guiding what kinds of DH work you are able to facilitate.&#34; He's right. Perhaps, as a practical response to that, plan and spend 75% (?) of your budget on what you know you want to do with the students. And leave 25% for cheap HW investments in experiments, risks and whatever might conceivably stick to the wall.. and mitigate the risk &#38;amp; difficulty of deciding what this might be by drawing in other units such as special collections, theatre, media studies, art history, studio art, linguistics, local/campus museums/archives etc.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Without a greater sense of the types of projects, it'll be a little hard to make decisions. If there's an emphasis on media production, &#60;a href='http://convergence.umw.edu/multimedia-editing-lab-soundbooth/'&#62;this media lab at UMW&#60;/a&#62; might be a good model, or at least give some example ideas.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Other software that might be fairly common for DH work:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* &#38;lt;oXygen/&#38;gt; XML editor&#60;br /&#62;
* R statistics package&#60;br /&#62;
* MALLET topic modeling&#60;br /&#62;
* Some kind of code editor&#60;br /&#62;
* Some FTP application&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Which of those would actually be used depends a lot on specific types of projects. No matter what choices you make, though, you'll be implicitly guiding what kinds of DH work you are able to facilitate. Those would probably cover a good range of interests, though.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Looking at the opportunity to write a quick proposal for equipment to be used in a new DH lab (space for 6, max 10 workstations) and thinking about generic needs of future colleagues and graduate student researchers.  The quandry -- we lack information about specific project needs which might emerge.  Any recommendations on the foundation or baseline for such a lab?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We just renovated a physics lab into a SCALE-UP format room. I'll digitize our plans and send 'em along to your gmail, if that's ok.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I will say this: The thing that people talked about the most during planning was literally the tables: what was the right size and shape to accommodate group work; to allow for free-and-easy movement around the tables, including up-and-down to the ubiquitous walltalker writing surfaces, etc. That took a lot of effort.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It has been pretty cool, though.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The folks at University of Mary Washington just opened &#60;a href=&#34;http://convergence.umw.edu/&#34;&#62;a shiny new building with lots of digital classroom space&#60;/a&#62;. You might be able to reach out to their &#60;a href=&#34;http://academics.umw.edu/dtlt/&#34;&#62;Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies&#60;/a&#62; for ideas and what they budgeted.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello - I am writing a proposal to renovate a traditional, fixed seating computer lab as a SCALE-UP style classroom suitable for teaching DH (among other things). What do you suggest for set up? Furniture, laptops, monitors, budget for software, etc. If anyone has a classroom and budget for a similar project, that would be especially helpful. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Caroline

&#60;p&#62;+1 to Vagrant. Vagrant's portability also means that if lab users get to a good point with a Vagrant instance on a lab machine, they should be more or less able to take a copy of the Vagrant instance with them.

&#60;p&#62;An update to #1 on my list: MAMP Pro 3 (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/&#60;/a&#62;) now lets you spin up a number of CMS sites (most importantly, Wordpress and Drupal) with a few clicks. Another option is to set up Vagrant (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.vagrantup.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.vagrantup.com/&#60;/a&#62;) to quickly and easily set up dev environments (including CMSs) that don't affect the host computer and can be ported to a live site easily (because Vagrant uses virtual machines, it's easier to make your dev and live environments exactly the same as to all those finicky server details like what version of PHP you're running, than it is with MAMP). Vagrant's site has user-friendly documentation, and it would be pretty easy for someone to create a several-step &#34;here's how to create your own Drupal or WP site on this lab machine&#34; flyer.

&#60;p&#62;To me more generous to Lincoln's intent, I should add that the notion of what you can support should include maintaining the ability to be accommodating when a critical mass of users would like something installed on all the workstations.

&#60;p&#62;Even though I haven't set up a DH lab, I have managed a public cluster and so wanted to throw in a few words for considering this aspect of things. From that perspective, one part of the answer to your question has to be, &#34;Nothing you can't support.&#34; By 'support' I don't mean that you have trained ninjas (or pirates or vampires, depending on where you fall in that religious war) for every application, but that you have funding, licensing, data, upgrade, and security management capabilities for everything that goes in. On that last note, I must say that when I was managing a public cluster, there's no way I would have gone with Lincoln's idea of allowing lab users to install their own software. That has huge potential to bork a system inside of 30 seconds. By the same token, providing support for users installing whatever on their own machines is a great idea. Teach a DHer to fish and all that.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One management tool and approach you might consider is Deep Freeze or one of its ilk. That software resets a computer to a default stat at a desired interval. I did not use it in my cluster management work, but I know entities on campus at my institution do.&#60;br /&#62;
There are similar programs for doing centralized patch management, but not all software plays nicely with this approach. You'll need to decide whether you mind doing manual, one-by-one updates on the machines or whether everything must be tractable from an MCP.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Finally, despite &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/miriamkp/status/212577424330858496&#34;&#62;some opposition to smartboards&#60;/a&#62;, I'd recommend one (or similar device or software overlay), if only because some of the people you are working with will likely sooner or later need to know intimately their features, benefits, and advantages.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[EDITED to make smartboard ref a proper link, and to add paragraph spacing]

&#60;p&#62;I'm not a Final Cut expert, but I've been using it to do pretty basic things (splicing, adjusting audio, adding text overlays) for lecture and demo videos without a hitch. Working with a simple consumer-aimed thing like iMovie before moving on to Final Cut certainly helped me understand the more advanced software better, so perhaps that's a better (and cheaper?) initial tool for graduate students.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some other things you might consider adding:&#60;br /&#62;
1. A friendly FTP GUI (Fetch or Filezilla).&#60;br /&#62;
2. This isn't exactly software, but you might provide encouragement to get familiar with the command line by, for example, keeping the Terminal icon in the Mac dock, posting simple commands students can emulate (e.g. you just transferred that file in Fetch, here's how to do the same thing way quicker via the command line; or better yet, here's how to customize your command prompt with custom greetings and colors as a way to feel like it's your own tool).&#60;br /&#62;
3. A good text editor (anything that does some color coding and handles closing tags; I love TextWrangler and also use Oxygen for TEI work).&#60;br /&#62;
4. A GitHub GUI (GitHub for Mac is great, and a Windows version came out recently) and a GitHub account. Not only a valuable tool, but a good way to keep earlier versions of work safe when people are trying new things.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Would be interested to hear back as your space develops. Have fun!
