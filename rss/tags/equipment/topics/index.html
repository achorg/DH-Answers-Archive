			<description>&#60;p&#62;Looking at the opportunity to write a quick proposal for equipment to be used in a new DH lab (space for 6, max 10 workstations) and thinking about generic needs of future colleagues and graduate student researchers.  The quandry -- we lack information about specific project needs which might emerge.  Any recommendations on the foundation or baseline for such a lab?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello - I am writing a proposal to renovate a traditional, fixed seating computer lab as a SCALE-UP style classroom suitable for teaching DH (among other things). What do you suggest for set up? Furniture, laptops, monitors, budget for software, etc. If anyone has a classroom and budget for a similar project, that would be especially helpful. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Caroline

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you could build your own DH lab, what would you stock it with? Anything from AV equipment to software to computer hardware is fair game. I'm envisioning a place where graduate students (mainly) and others would have the space and tools to experiment, learn, and do research and/or produce media.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Aside: I notice there's not a category in DHAnswers for these sorts of infrastructure questions.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm making a tech request to upgrade/renovate/build a tech lab for the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative here at MSU (chi.matrix.msu.edu).  I've got some general ideas as to what is going to be in the request.  However, I thought I would throw the question out to the community and see if people had suggestions for purchases - stuff that I may not have thought about.  These could include software, hardware, peripherals, online services &#38;amp; sites, etc.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This lab would mostly be used for cultural heritage informatics projects - anthropology, archaeology, history, classics, art history, museology, historic geography, etc.  (though, that hardly is a good representation of the kinds of things that it might end up being used for).  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, what would you request?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
