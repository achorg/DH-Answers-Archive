			<description>&#60;p&#62;You might like to take a look at Heurist - &#60;a href=&#34;http://HeuristNetwork.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://HeuristNetwork.org&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It might not at first appear to be what you are looking for - it's a generic database for Humanities data - but it is easily configured to handle image metadata, including DC, so out-of-the-box might be a day to get set up. It handles remotely stored images eg. in Picasa, as well as indexing images in situ. It has good querying, including facetted queries in version 4 (to be released this month). Out-of-the box it gives you mapping and timelines, as well as connections between entities (which can include images, creators, owner, collections, auctions etc). It's currently handling in the 25,000 image range for a first world war project and a study on Balinese artists, including a mixture of jpg, tif and PDF.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm happy to assist with setting up an out-of-the-box image database - it's something I need to do for another project - and once that's done it really will be a 5 minute job to build a new image database. Email me on: &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:ian.johnson@sydney.edu.au&#34;&#62;ian.johnson@sydney.edu.au&#60;/a&#62; (in western Europe time zone until late June).

&#60;p&#62;I like the &#34;back in the day&#34; phrase - I remember these conferences at ALLC/ACH conferences in the mid-90s. The proffered solutions cost thousands of dollars. You'd think by now...*sigh*

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I, too, have been looking for a solution but perhaps should define what I mean by solution before assuming this is what everyone wants. I want:&#60;br /&#62;
- to handle a collection of hundreds of images.&#60;br /&#62;
- ability to browse through them quickly (by image, not just by name--rather like you can do in a &#34;Cover Flow&#34; view in a Finder window on a Mac) because sometimes it's easier to see the one you want rather than try to remember what text strings are associated with it to search on.&#60;br /&#62;
- ability to assign standard metadata (probably Dublin Core) as well as tags, then sort on those. Faceted sorting/browsing would be nice too.&#60;br /&#62;
- ability to sort based on any metadata or tag field and deliver the browse view described above. (This is where things break down.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, I've used dSpace - tedious metadata entry (when is that not the case?) but easy searching and the resulting view is reasonably browse-able. I've used Omeka: ditto on the metadata, not so great on the searching/browsing unless you can customize your own Collection display view. I've used iPhoto but as soon as you try to port the images somewhere else there always seem to be problems, not to mention the metadata is...metadata? what metadata? And other things that were even worse.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Back in the day, some of our Art History faculty in Chicago swore by Extensis Portfolio (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.extensis.com/digital-asset-management/portfolio/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.extensis.com/digital-asset-management/portfolio/)&#60;/a&#62;. Another possibility for desktop tools might be Canto Cumulus (though it may not pass your &#34;out of the box&#34; test).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm sure if you (or someone who is a member) posted this to a forum used by the Visual Resources Association community (&#38;lt;VRA-L@LISTSERV.UARK.EDU&#38;gt;) you'd get additional and fuller answers. Also (just guessing though) you might even be able to find some discussion of this in the abstracts for their annual conference.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Patrick Murray-John's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-are-people-using-to-manage-large-collections-of-images#post-2309&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I kind of think … not? Unless I'm missing something. The problem is that, while Zotero does a lovely job with metadata, attachments are hard to see unless you deliberately open them up. That's why scholars are using iPhoto, I think — you can at least see at a glance what you have in your collection.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I also have never tried bulk-importing things into Zotero, and I don't know how well that works. My sense is that a lot of people (*cough* me *cough*) already have large, disorganized collections of archival images, and entering metadata for them one at a time would be a lot to handle.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Not that I have, or know anyone who has, but would that other RRCHNM project Zotero work for some of these needs?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am trying to deal with thousands of archival images--mostly documents but lots of visuals too--and am also struggling for a solution. A colleague has suggested that I convert the JPGs into PDFs, OCR them, and then manage them in DevonThinkPro, where I can tag, annotate, search, organize. I am new to this and am still figuring out a workflow. Adobe Acrobat is balking at OCR'ing PDFs I made from iPhone JPGs (saying they are too large in inches, not data) and I haven't worked with DevonThinkPro enough to say if it is the right solution for me. But I'm hoping DevonThinkPro, which can handle most formats, allows me to manage the images. Yes, it's a lot of steps, so if you come up with other solutions, I'm all ears!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm curious to know what software humanities scholars are using to wrangle large collections of images. I often encounter scholars who struggle to manage large image collections — it's not at all unusual to find people managing collections of historical images with iPhoto — and wondered if there are databases that make sense for visual collections. I'm especially interested in programs that:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;work out of the box and have a GUI (sorry)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;are designed for individuals, not enterprises&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;allow a scholar to quickly apprehend many images at once&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;allow one to add metadata (like place and date) — something beyond tags would be nice — and construct queries&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;make sense for people who have a lot of digital surrogates of primary sources (which is to say, systems that are optimized to retrieve the EXIF data from a photo of an archival document won't make a whole lot of sense)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know about Picasa, LightRoom, and ImagePlot. I don't think an enterprise-level system like ContenDM or the like makes sense for individual scholars. Omeka, of course, is nice, but it's a bit unwieldy if you're just trying to manage a collection. What am I missing?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/jennriley'&#62;jennriley&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-do-you-want-full-text-provided-to-you-for-analysis#post-1893&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My model repository would be &#60;a href=&#34;http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/&#34;&#62;Chronicling America;&#60;/a&#62; the Library of Congress did a very nice job assembling linked open data on a hierarchical set, and (now) allowing updated downloads of the full corpus. And it's possible to just pull one article at a time without any fuss—anything that creates a low barrier to entry (using JSON as well as XML for metadata, for example) helps. Plus they have a nice suits of additional APIs (for snipped image data, for example)—obviously a smaller project won't want to do all of them, but some might be available.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm a fan of HathiTrust's system. They have .zip files for each volume, with pages stored as separate .txt files within the zip. Then they have metadata for each volume as a .json object. Multiple volumes that are part of the same &#34;work&#34; (or I suppose, ms collection) can be linked via a record id.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;All of this is available (as copyright permits) via an API.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Of course, this system would require some adaptation to apply to mss. But I'm mentioning HathiTrust as an example because I think it's going to be valuable in the long run to aim for &#60;em&#62;some&#60;/em&#62; kind of consistency across repositories.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're in the early planning stages of an initiative that will make available full text for some of our special collections library's manuscript holdings. We'll definitely provide a search interface, but we'd also like to allow the full text of these resources to be downloaded for researchers to use in text mining and whatever other applications suit their fancy. As a researcher doing this kind of work, what's the most useful way for us to make this full text available to you? One big download? Something else? Are there examples out there of sites that do this particularly well that we should model our capabilities after?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for your input!&#60;br /&#62;

				<title>jlmcdonald@gmail.com on "Have you used MongoDB for DH project?"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/have-you-used-mongodb-for-dh-project#post-1851</link>
			<pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2013 14:49:03 +0000</pubDate>
			<dc:creator>jlmcdonald@gmail.com</dc:creator>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">1851@http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/</guid>
			<description>&#60;p&#62;I think MongoDB has a lot to offer DH projects -- it basically incorporates some of the best features of a document-oriented database and a relational database all in one. For so much of the data often worked with in DH projects, that are sometimes squished and squeezed so much to fit a relational model that never quite works, a schemaless approach to indexing and storing data like Mongo has works very well. I especially see value for those projects that don't need a full-blown structured repository like FEDORA, but that need more than flat files or relational DBs can do.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Having said that, the biggest thing to consider is that you say using MySQL works very well already for you. If you can't tell that there is something missing, not-quite-right, or not efficient enough with your current setup, the transition to Mongo may not be worth the effort in the long run. Mongo is pretty straightforward to set up, but it does approach data differently and doesn't use SQL at all, so when you say you'd be rewriting the backend, you'd really be rewriting it! You have to evaluate your data itself to know if the effort is worth it. Is your data tabular, or document-based? Are you mostly dealing with numbers and simple structured data (with some relationships), or heavily semantic data with complex metadata?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Perhaps another path to consider, if you decide to rewrite your back end, is to completely decouple it from your front end. Create a thin layer that is nothing but a RESTful API -- the api talks to the DB and only spits out structured JSON on the other end. This would also likely require some tweaking of your front end, but it will A) make it so you can then very easily write multiple other front ends (mobile, TV, etc) without a hitch, and B) 3 years from now, if you decide to change out the DB layer again, it's much easier to then create a new API generator that will offer the same data structures than it is to create an all new backend interface. There are lots of starting point solutions for quickly generating RESTful APIs whether your DB is MySQL, Mongo, or something else.
