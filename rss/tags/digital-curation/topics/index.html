			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am asking this question on behalf of Media Studies professor Hector Amaya. He is working on a project revolving around the Narco-violence phenomenon on the US-Mexico border. As part of his project he wants to archive a series of blogs that have sprouted on the blogosphere reacting to the violence. The blogs are a sort of citizens media that functions in lieu of an effectively intimidated official media. The blogs (and the bloggers) are of course very vulnerable. Here are two of the key blogs:  El Blog del Narco: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.blogdelnarco.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.blogdelnarco.com/&#60;/a&#62; and El Mundo del Narco: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mundonarco.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mundonarco.com/&#60;/a&#62;. There are many other he wants to archive, but other than the InternetArchive, I don't know anyone who has done this. An HTML capture will probably work, but I don't even know how one would do that with a series of blogs. Any ideas?
