			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;br /&#62;
I'm putting together assignments for next semester's digital history class, and want to construct a simple distant reading for my students, probably using Voyant Tools (unless there is a very easy-to-use pure HTML/Javascript set of tools that will let my students use some of the basic JS skills they'll have acquired in their previous assignment).  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would like to present them with existing corpora of historical texts: preferably not literature, but newspapers/government documents, letters etc. Most archives I've found use PDF images with mediocre to poor OCR.  Can anyone point me to a good collection of historical corpora that students can experiment with?  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This question is really fascinating (especially since I suspect I have inkling of &#60;a href=&#34;http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/&#34;&#62;the sort of texts&#60;/a&#62; you're interested in). Let me just dump a handful of links which I think might be helpful from my recent delicious/pinboard (hmm... delicious pinboard).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While I can't point to specific results/papers. Aditi Muralidharan (@silverasm)'s WordSeer project is promising interesting results about slave narratives, though it does not rely on TEI. In &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aditi/projects/wordseer.html&#34;&#62;this talk&#60;/a&#62;, though, she does a good job of answering Sean's question directly--how can metadata improve on generic full-text search. WordSeer (as I understand it) works mostly by supplementing raw text with part of speech tagging and other grammatical metadata.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With respect to TEI specifically one obvious place to start, I think, is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.monkproject.org/&#34;&#62;MONK&#60;/a&#62;; as Dorothea notes, Martin Mueller is involved with the MONK project. You can find him summarizing MONK &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cocoon/tei2008/programme/abstracts/abstract-169.html&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62; and at greater length &#60;a href=&#34;https://apps.lis.illinois.edu/wiki/display/MONK/Notes+towards+a+user+manual+of+Monk&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;. Unlike WordSeer, the Monk Workbench gives you metadata about author (including gender) and publication date. Matt Kirschenbaum mentions MONK in &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~hillol/NGDM07/abstracts/talks/MKirschenbaum.pdf&#34;&#62;this article&#60;/a&#62; [PDF].&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(How relevant it will be to you, I don't know, but when I heard John Unsworth speak recently, he talked about the work flow and complications of large text collections with different encoding standards--with reference to MONK in particular. You can hear him &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.scholarslab.org/podcasts/unsworth-idiosyncrasy-at-scale/&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There was a &#60;a href=&#34;http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1104&#38;amp;L=TEI-L&#38;amp;F=&#38;amp;S=&#38;amp;O=T&#38;amp;H=0&#38;amp;D=0&#38;amp;T=1#34&#34;&#62;recent discussion&#60;/a&#62; on the TEI list about eXist from which I learned a lot--again, about what's possible rather than specific results/reports.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Finally--this one is also not TEI specific--if you haven't seen Ben Schmidt's blog, he is doing some pretty impressive stuff. This post, on &#60;a href=&#34;http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/04/age-cohort-and-vocabulary-use.html&#34;&#62;vocabulary use and age cohort&#60;/a&#62; gives some idea.
