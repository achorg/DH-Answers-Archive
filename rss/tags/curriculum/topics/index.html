			<description>&#60;p&#62;There are now a number of universities offering courses in digital history. When you look at individual syllabi, however, there is quite a variety in approaches or topics covered. If you were given the task of designing a curriculum or a series of courses to be taught alongside more traditional history courses, what would you include? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Let's say it's a series of 4 courses, one per semester over 2 years, that begins with first year students (undergraduate freshmen) with a goal of producing digitally &#34;nimble&#34; history students or even digital historians (feel free to define both of those!). How would you balance theory, general information literacy skills, projects, programming, etc? What would be the &#34;must include&#34; pieces and which would be the ideal? What mix of lecture-based, active learning/project based, discussion/seminar, online/face-to-face/hybrid or other configuration would you build?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
