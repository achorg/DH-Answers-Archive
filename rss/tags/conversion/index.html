			<description>&#60;p&#62;Do keep in mind that the approach recommended here strips the markup away, leaving only the text in between the tags.  Since the TEI (and other document-based XML languages) generally leave the transcribed text inside tags (rather than as, say, the values of attributes), this approach will work quite well.  But also keep in mind that the TEI has intentionally given up on the naive assumption that if you strip away the markup, you get the exact text that appeared on the page.  For example, the TEI's&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;pre&#62;choice&#60;/pre&#62;
 element includes text between tags for more than one interpretation of what you see on the page, so these two strings will appear in the output of the above command sequences, one after the other, while the source document contained only one of these (though the encoder is unclear on which).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So beware that things like will introduce errors in your OCR training.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much everyone for your help - both techniques worked equally well. I still need to swap some characters and remove line breaks from the processed texts but I can easily batch that in my text editor. Thanks again!

&#60;p&#62;I was going to suggest something similar to Hugh, though the text() syntax doesn't seem to work when I test, but this does:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;pre&#62;xmllint --xpath &#34;string(//*[local-name()='body'])&#34; FILENAME.xml&#60;/pre&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;@&#60;a href='http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/profile/cforster'&#62;cforster&#60;/a&#62; is almost certainly right that you want an XSLT. It all depends on the level of encoding and whether you really want all of the text, laid out as it is in the document (maybe there are footnotes in the OCR for example that have been turned into inline notes in the TEI).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, if you really just want a dead-simple text extraction, you can do something like the following with xmllint:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;code&#62;xmllint --xpath &#34;//*[local-name() ='text']//text()&#34; flle.xml&#60;/code&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That can be bundled up with a find command (or other method of iterating over the files) and the output redirected to files in order to do your batch processing.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Well, &#60;em&#62;best&#60;/em&#62; is a tricky one. But if you're comfortable using XSLT this is pretty classic XSLT sort of problem. The default XSLT rules are to essentially output the content of the nodes so a &#60;em&#62;very&#60;/em&#62; simple script could do what you're looking to do (I've done it many times before). Chances are, though, that you are going to want to trip out the teiHeader and just get the body of the text. You can write an empty rule to match the teiHeader, which will have the effect of silencing its output. A simple (though imperfect may to do this would be an XSLT stylesheet something like the following:&#60;/p&#62;


&#60;div class=&#34;bb_syntax&#34;&#62;&#60;div class=&#34;code&#34;&#62;&#60;pre class=&#34;xslt&#34; style=&#34;font-family:monospace;&#34;&#62;&#38;lt;?xml version=&#38;quot;1.0&#38;quot; encoding=&#38;quot;utf-8&#38;quot;?&#38;gt;
&#38;nbsp;
&#38;lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:tei=&#38;quot;http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0&#38;quot;
  xmlns=&#38;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&#38;quot;
  xmlns:xsl=&#38;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&#38;quot; version=&#38;quot;1.0&#38;quot;&#38;gt;
&#38;nbsp;
  &#38;lt;xsl:output method=&#38;quot;text&#38;quot; encoding=&#38;quot;UTF-8&#38;quot; /&#38;gt;
&#38;nbsp;
  &#38;lt;xsl:template match=&#38;quot;tei:TEI&#38;quot;&#38;gt;
    &#38;lt;xsl:apply-templates /&#38;gt;
  &#38;lt;/xsl:template&#38;gt;
&#38;nbsp;
  &#38;lt;xsl:template match=&#38;quot;tei:teiHeader&#38;quot;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/xsl:template&#38;gt;
&#38;nbsp;
&#38;lt;/xsl:stylesheet&#38;gt;&#60;/pre&#62;&#60;/div&#62;&#60;/div&#62;



&#60;p&#62;If you're on OSX, the built-in xslt processor (xsltproc) can handle this. Just save the above XSLT code into a file (call it strip.xsl) and then, at the command line: &#60;code&#62;xsltproc strip.xsl [TEI FILE NAME]&#60;/code&#62;. By default this outputs to standard input (i.e. the screen), but you can pipe it into a file &#60;code&#62;xsltproc strip.xsl [TEI FILE NAME] &#38;gt; stripped.txt&#60;/code&#62;. And at this point if you can write a shell script, it should be possible to loop over all the files in a directory.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd like to use the available corpora in the German Text Archive (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/download&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/download&#60;/a&#62;) to train OCR software. For this I need these texts as plaintext. All the German Text Archive texts however are all TEI P5 tagged. How do I best convert these (hundreds..) of documents into plaintext? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm comfortable on the command line and with small shell scripts but I wouldn't be able to write an app to make use of a public API to such a service. Ideally I'd like to find some tei2text-ish command line tool but the ones I've found in googling around and looking on GitHub don't appear (to me, leastways) to be suitable for TEI texts.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello, you can also try our Doc To HTML Converter [www.doctohtml.com], which converts MS Word documents into clean &#34;web&#34; (X)HTML. It does not use MS Word built-in conversion engine at all, and performs conversion entirely on its own, although using MS Word to access the original document, thus delivering the best possible HTML code.&#60;br /&#62;
The program requires MS Word 2000+ to be installed.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;My best is to copy from Word and 'paste special' into the design view of Dreamweaver. Then do clean up HTML. Then find and replace special characters in code view. Still tedious, but pretty good results.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;well, whether mr textfixer is the best answer probably depends what you're actually trying to do... if you're happy to throw away all your images and most of the structure of your word file, and if no-one has managed to get you to update to more recent versions of microsoft office, and if you're happy to go on working with the web circa 1997, then yup, it's a pretty good answer. otherwise, no.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dreamweaver has had a &#34;clean up Word HTML&#34; feature for several years.   I wouldn't recommend buying the program for this purpose but if you can get access to a copy, it might be worthwhile testing a problematic document.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The only text constructs Word understands are paragraph-level elements and spans of characters.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The way we coped with text structures larger than a paragraph (such as a list) back when I was working in typesetting/SGML was to make sure that those structures actually had at least four associated Word paragraph styles. Using a list as example (but the same idea works for abstracts, block quotations, etc.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;one for the first item in a list (visually: extra space on top)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;one for a middle list item&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;one for a final list item (visually: extra space below)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;and one for a one-item list (visually: extra space above and below)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Clunky though this undoubtedly is, getting markup out of it is relatively painless. It does get even uglier when you have multi-paragraph list items... but that's fortunately rather rare.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Oxygen was worth trying and would certainly be useful for other things, but Word just isn't being cooperative enough – the way it treats bulleted lists as styled paragraphs, for instance. Which means that, like you, I'm back to regex in a text editor.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;My first thought was to clean it up semi manually using regular expressions in a good text editor like BBEdit, TextMate, or oXygen (the latter is my tool of choice given its XML etc. savviness).  I've done this many times, but it was always painful.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;But a new feature of oXygen XML Editor v12.1 comes to mind:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;Smart Paste - Automatic Conversion to DITA, DocBook, TEI, etc.&#60;br /&#62;
Styled content can be inserted by copying content from Office applications (for example Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice.org Writer and OpenOffice.org Calc) and Web browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.) and pasting it in the Author editor. The styles and general layout of the copied content, like sections with headings, tables, list items, bold and italic text, hyperlinks, are converted in the target document equivalent XML elements. &#38;lt;oXygen/&#38;gt; provides default implementations for the following document types: DITA, DocBook, TEI, XHTML but this support can be configured also for user defined document types.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So the idea would be to open the Word HTML file in a web browser, copy the desired text, then paste it into a new XHTML document in oXygen's Author mode.  Haven't tried it with this combination of source and destination formats, but I was pleased with the results when I pasted generic web content into a new TEI file.  May be promising for you.
