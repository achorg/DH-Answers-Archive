			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been unsure how to respond to this question, because it's so big and complicated.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;All the tools and resources mentioned are right on, and you'll discover how useful they are for your specific purposes as you go along.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;But, at the risk of bouncing off my personal experience, that doesn't say much about how I &#60;em&#62;learned&#60;/em&#62; to code. I worked from a pile of O'Reilly books, and wish that I had all of the resources that are now available online. That's not &#60;em&#62;how&#60;/em&#62; I learned, though. Those are tools to help give info and examples.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So. How did I learn to code?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;First. Get to know how you learn. (skipping the 'to code' part)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Do you learn from following examples? Or do you learn from studying the abstract principles, and learning how to apply them? Or something else? The point is that the basic 'how do I learn' seems most important.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Okay, then, 'how do I learn to code' (which seems like the question underlying what you stated)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm a big fan of instant gratification. However you go at it, trying something that'll produce quick results that you can see and be proud of is great fun. It's not like an article for a journal where you wait ages for feedback. You can produce your own feedback by trying something and seeing immediately what the result is. Even if it doesn't seem directly related to upcoming project(s), that's a great way to learn. The more you do it, the more you'll be able to tackle bigger things, with more deferred payoff. It's like going through the training rounds in a game.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Be comfortable not knowing things. Then experiment to taste to learn them.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Maybe even take a cue from the creative writers, and seek out/form a coding group, just like writers get into writing groups. That's not something I did, but some experiences were close, and DH is ready to have those. Forums or dev lists for software or projects are a good approximation.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;When in doubt, try it out!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;br /&#62;
I started my PhD last year and have been learning to code for it. My research is using R and I've taken a couple of online courses, I also found Matthew Jockers' book Text Analysis With R for Students of Literature helpful. There is a great online community for R with tutorials and how to videos, and Stack Exchage has been great for specific problems.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With TEI practice is key, working or volunteering on a project which uses TEI really helps. I've helped on the Letters of 1916 project which uses TEI encoding. Anyone can log in and transcribe letters, the transcription desk uses a small number of tags which helps you become familiar with a few before moving onto more complex examples.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Wow, thank you all for the wonderful advice and resources. I am in a DH course at LSU right now, and I shared your responses with my classmates, who were also very happy for the practical tips. I have a network visualization project in mind, and I found beginning lessons on Programming Historian, so I might start there. If you are interested in what we're up to at LSU, we have a class website at &#60;a href=&#34;http://engl7121s16.laurenacoats.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://engl7121s16.laurenacoats.org/&#60;/a&#62;, which includes our syllabus and weekly posts about our digital explorations. Thanks again!

&#60;p&#62;As an add-on to Scott's #1: the Firebug extension (available for Firefox, can't remember if there's a Chrome version currently) is both a great way to learn about website HTML and CSS, and a fantastic tool to use everyday as a web designer. It lets you click on specific pieces of a webpage to see how they're coded, and it also lets you temporarily make changes to the webpage by playing with the existing HTML and CSS (e.g. you can visit the New York Times' webpage and alter its font type or color, change how articles are spaced, etc.). Sometimes taking an existing site and trying to alter it a bit is a good way of learning how it was built.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;Hi, Leah! You might be interested in reading this collection of &#34;how I got started&#34; stories from the participants at a recent symposium on DH development (the NEH-funded UVa Scholars' Lab's Speaking in Code): &#60;a href=&#34;http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/starting/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/starting/&#60;/a&#62; Some of these are more origin stories than steps to get started, but some might have some information that's useful (especially since the conference was focused on making tacit DH development knowledge more public).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There's also a Digital Humanities Slack (an online chat forum with specific rooms for chatting about DH questions, coding, teaching DH, etc.) you're very welcome to join via &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.TinyUrl.com/DHSlack&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.TinyUrl.com/DHSlack&#60;/a&#62;. It's a good place to ask questions if any come up as you're coding—or if you want recommendations for tools to build on or programming languages to use.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Here are a couple of tips:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1. Begin by learning html and css to code your own website (there are plenty of online tutorials, including codeacademy.com). After you get the basics, decide what else you would like to do and then Google &#34;How do I do _________ in html/css&#34;? (You fill in the blank.) You'll find plenty of answers online. Get used to this Google procedure; it's the best way to learn. Look especially for answers on stackoverflow.com.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2. TEI is overwhelming, and most projects only use a tiny bit of the schema. So it is best to have a specific project which requires only a few elements that are easy to understand. Eventually, you'll come across a situation that is not so clear, and for this you'll have to start reading the TEI guidelines. One helpful tip I've found is to go to a definition of an element like &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-unclear.html&#34;&#62;unclear&#60;/a&#62; in the index, scroll to the bottom to see an example, and then back to the top to click on the links to the chapter discussion. That's how I've gradually become much more familiar with how to apply the TEI Guidelines.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Both of the above examples involve descriptive coding. If you want to learn programming, I suggest starting with Python, in part because I second The Programming Historian as a source of good tutorials. DARIAH-DE's &#60;a href=&#34;https://de.dariah.eu/tatom/&#34;&#62;Text Analysis with Topic Models&#60;/a&#62; is another good set of tutorials, though you need to have some Python basics down first. &#60;a href=&#34;http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/&#34;&#62;Learn Python the Hard Way&#60;/a&#62; is (despite the name) a very good place to start. Another good language to learn is PHP, which is the basis for Wordpress. It may be the easiest language (along with Javascript) to extend the functionality of your websites. In all these cases, there is a wealth of code samples and discussion about how to do things on stackoverflow.com.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Leah - it helps to have a pretty good sense of what it is you want to be doing, I think. Otherwise, all of the tutorials one might follow quickly become too abstract. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some folks have found codeacademy.com very helpful; it might be more useful for you, to start, to look at some 'how did they make that?' videos or articles: &#60;a href=&#34;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that-the-video/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that-the-video/&#60;/a&#62;  and &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Programming Historian has lots of great stuff, and we're setting up a kind of community work-through-the-tutorials-and-annotate-them-where-things-get-tricksy (see &#60;a href=&#34;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/02/DHannotates&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://literaturegeek.com/2016/02/02/DHannotates&#60;/a&#62; ). Depending on where you're starting from, you might also find things like workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca  or themacroscope.org helpful (things I've written for my own class).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm a PhD in English student, and I'm interested in (but very new to) DH. I will start working with TEI soon through a digital archive project I'm working on, so there's that. What other avenues should I explore in my quest to learn coding for the sake of DH research?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I agree with Patrick that the best (and most well-trodden!) path to engagement in DH is to invest some real time in DIY tinkering and good old fashioned puttering around, particularly if you can focus your experimentation on a project or investigation you find inherently motivating.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In terms of newbie-friendly programs and conferences, &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org&#34;&#62;THATCamps&#60;/a&#62; are terrific, low-cost and friendly introductions to DH.  They're tremendous regional networking opportunities as well -- but you'll also find a welcoming community at the annual &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org&#34;&#62;DH conference&#60;/a&#62; (where the &#60;a href=&#34;http://ach.org&#34;&#62;ACH&#60;/a&#62; hosts a longstanding &#60;a href=&#34;http://ach.org/mentoring&#34;&#62;mentoring program&#60;/a&#62;, which now runs year-round) and at conferences like SDH-SEMI (see, for example, &#60;a href=&#34;http://sdh-semi.org/2012/04/01/introductory-workshopts-on-digital-humanities-at-congress-2012-in-waterloo/&#34;&#62;these workshops&#60;/a&#62;, held just last week).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Most of the North American training institutes with which I'm familiar (like &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhsi.org&#34;&#62;DHSI&#60;/a&#62; and the new &#60;a href=&#34;http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/&#34;&#62;DHWI&#60;/a&#62;) are open to independent scholars and work hard to cover costs or keep them reasonably low. The various NEH-supported &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/institutes&#34;&#62;IATDH programs&#60;/a&#62; are generally a bit more advanced (that's what the &#34;A&#34; stands for), but also open to people without institutional affiliation and costs are usually covered.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;More and more training programs are being attached to disciplinary conferences. I'm not sure what's in the works for AHA, but the &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org/&#34;&#62;DH Commons&#60;/a&#62; group will host another &#34;Getting Started in DH&#34; workshop at the MLA conference this January. (And you should definitely register with and explore DH Commons in general!)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Staying plugged in with Twitter is now a must. &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/&#34;&#62;DH Now&#60;/a&#62; can help you follow the conversations being had in the community, and discover new resources. It's being drawn from &#60;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&#38;amp;hl=en_US&#38;amp;key=0AucqXAIBhf_idGNlZzVjSGkxQU9XNU4yb0w1clMxeXc&#38;amp;single=true&#38;amp;gid=3&#38;amp;output=html&#34;&#62;these people&#60;/a&#62; and their feeds -- also worth some exploration.  And I'm sure you've already discovered past threads on DH Answers that speak to basic readings, tools and platforms, etc. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Welcome and best of luck!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I kinda have to giggle, just at how quickly perceptions and activity around DH are changing. The giggly case in point, your question about how open the field is to humanists who are not digital. DH is chock-full of people who came to it from not being digital, so we're all about new humanists becoming more digitally/technologically savvy!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some of the institutes and workshops do assume a certain level of knowledge, but often they are just as appropriate for newcomers. If it isn't clear in the descriptions, &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is probably coming from how I got into DH, but good places to start are just using some of the open source tools for a real project, or research, or some other activity. Easy possible gateways are starting a wordpress blog for your research on wordpress.com, then if you want more control of the site to install your own wordpress installation on a shared hosting service like bluehost.com or dreamhost.com. Or, similarly, producing an omeka site on omeka.net and put together a research project there, and/or install your own omeka on a shared hosting service to do so. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Installing your own on a shared hosting service is a pretty good way to make first steps into becoming &#34;digital&#34;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If there's one coming up in your area, I'd also suggest attending a &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62;. I know a couple people in situations similar to what you describe from THATCamps.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is clearly from the &#34;Do-It-Yourself/Build-It-Yourself&#34; perspective on DH, so I imagine you will get responses with lots of other great ideas from other perspectives. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Good luck!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello All,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I’m a historian who, after some years of teaching, has veered off the T-T seeking track but remains committed to research. The&#60;br /&#62;
plethora of innovative current DH projects has caused me to investigate entering the field, but I seem to have hit a snag. I'm strictly a historian, with no computing background. I've noticed that DH is a hot new training field for grad students, recent PhDs, or those with institutional affiliation, but what if, like me, you are further down the academic track, wanting to become trained or involved in these initiatives, *but* no longer affiliated with an institution?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Are there any specific paths or opportunities you would recommend to become involved in the field (say, in existing projects)? On a related note, how open is the field to humanists who are not, well, digital? While I've noted summer institutes or workshops, those seem geared to people already steeped in DH. In short, I’d value hearing your thoughts on gaining practical experience from a relatively outlier perspective. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've struggled a bit with this, too, since the field is so broad. Sometimes I'd think I'd done a great job explaining, only to have librarians tell me later that my explanation was confusing. I've learned to try to tailor my explanation to the group I'm talking to, and to spend a lot of time on a few projects rather than slaloming through a bunch. So if I'm in a presentation setting, I'll try to get a sense of what the audience might find interesting. Some of my go-to example projects are those that are easily grasped, visually impressive, and clearly accomplish something that couldn't easily be accomplished as a monograph: &#60;a href=&#34;https://republicofletters.stanford.edu/&#34;&#62;Mapping the Republic of Letters, &#60;/a&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.americanpast.org/voting/&#34;&#62;Voting America&#60;/a&#62;, and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/index.faces&#34;&#62;Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database&#60;/a&#62;, for example. You don't need a technical background to see what these projects do and why they're cool. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My favorite online directories include the &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/The_CUNY_Digital_Humanities_Resource_Guide&#34;&#62;CUNY Digital Humanities Guide&#60;/a&#62;, Lisa Spiro's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/getting-started-in-the-digital-humanities/&#34;&#62;&#34;Getting Started in the Digital Humanities,&#34;&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://arts-humanities.net/&#34;&#62;arts-humanities.net&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are many examples of library-based DH, too: &#60;a href=&#34;http://scholar.library.miami.edu/archivoteatral/&#34;&#62;The Cuban Theater Digital Archive&#60;/a&#62;, the &#60;a href=&#34;http://livingstone.library.ucla.edu/&#34;&#62;Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project&#60;/a&#62;, and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://docsouth.unc.edu/blueridgeparkway/&#34;&#62;Digital Blue Ridge Parkway&#60;/a&#62;, to name a few. Projects like these might provide some inspiration if your library is looking for ways to support DH.
