			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm working on an Omeka project with a class, and am concerned about the kinds of images we might be able to include with our item records. The class is about popular culture and childhood, and the students are nominating for inclusion (&#38;amp; writing item records about) objects that were significant to their own experiences with pop cult as kids; this results in an archive full of items like Jersey Shore and Harry Potter which are very much still in copyright. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know this isn't the right forum for specific questions about copyright, but is there someplace I could turn to get some feedback about this project? I've often wondered whether there might be some entity out there that would offer pro bono advice to people working in education who are worried about committing inadvertent copyright violations.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks.&#60;br /&#62;
Rebecca
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working on a long-term database project involving literature and economics, in which I'm gathering price data from a wide range of 18th and 19th century English texts.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On my project website, I have an editorial statement and FAQ designed to provide context for the project both for people who are familiar with lit./econ. studies, and less so. I don't want to give away my IP, so most of the project itself is walled off. But I'm at the stage where I'm going to be looking for interested collaborators, and so I'd like to put as much on display as possible while protecting my work. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With that in mind, I'm trying to make a decision about whether to share a sample entry with full TEI markup. It's important, I think, that I show how my work uses the current TEI guidelines; especially because in a couple of areas, I'm extending them to meet the needs of my data. That brings me to the data dictionary, and the question of whether to make it visible, so that people can see my rationale for the choices I've made.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I could password protect some parts of the site, and maintain a certain amount of control over who can access it that way, but that doesn't provide a lot of security, and to be truthful, I'd prefer to have the site open, so that someone who found it could explore without having to contact me first.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I looked back through previous posts, and though I found acknowledgments that code is often kept out of the public eye, I didn't find any clear statements regarding the fine balance between making code public as a way of illustrating that you know what you're doing; and sharing too much.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Anyone have any recommendations? And thanks, very much, in advance.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;At THATCamp New England, right now, we're talking about the practice some institutions have of digitizing public domain images and then putting all kinds of license restrictions on them.  This is probably not ideal: they're free to &#60;em&#62;sell&#60;/em&#62; those images, but putting restrictions on them seems sketchy.  On the other hand, they did digitize them and make them available.  For an example, see Matthew Battles' article &#60;a href=&#34;http://hilobrow.com/2010/10/07/space-for-sale/&#34;&#62;&#34;Space For Sale.&#34;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;An idea is being floated: what if image providers (cultural institutions and commercial providers) were required to put up a notice, something like: &#34;The content of this image is in the public domain.  You may be able to find a free copy of it elsewhere.&#34;?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If we were to assume that restricting the use of public domain images is not best practice, what are institutional examples of best practice?  What institutions fall short of best practice?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It seems to us that the Getty example in Battles' article falls under the latter category.  Google Books (see &#60;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#38;amp;answer=44666&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=43738&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;) seems to follow best practice.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To be clear: most of these thoughts are not mine but the collective's.  :)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I work in contemporary literature, so almost everything I study is under copyright. Many things I study are available in attenuated digital formats like google books, or kindle editions, but those sorts of formats are not available for doing even a simple text manipulation or visualization, like, say slamming it into Wordle. Other that pushing for available full-access digital editions, what tools are there out there for those times when you find yourself confronted with something that is irredeemably paper?
