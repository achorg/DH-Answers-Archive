			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hmm...sorry if a repost, first attempt failed.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you have access to a plagiarism-detection app, have you tried seeing what that might return? Seems like same or similar algorithms might be appropriate.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been working on a very similar problem with a colleague who wants to identify text reuse among nineteenth-century codes of civil procedure. Here are two sample analyses with code in R, &#60;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/lmullen/24776&#34;&#62;one that calculates similarities between documents and locates them within the document&#60;/a&#62;, and another that &#60;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/lmullen/24945&#34;&#62;creates a comparison matrix&#60;/a&#62; among a small set of documents. The basic method is to break the text up into 5-grams (though this number is arbitrary and could be improved upon) and then calculate the percentage of borrowings and browse them with a keywords-in-context function. The 5-grams work around the problem of minor changes in language or bad OCR. This code is rough still, but for our test corpus of a couple million words, it seems to be performing better than I had expected.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Have you pushed the texts through whatever plagiarism detection apps are available to you (if any)? Seems like those algorithms are close to the ones you are looking for, and so might make a good start.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Browsing the Mathematica online help today, I found that it offers &#60;a href=&#34;http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/SequenceAlignmentAndComparison.html&#34;&#62;several functions for aligning &#38;amp; comparing string sequences&#60;/a&#62;. A web search for #&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/tags/dh'&#62;dh&#60;/a&#62; projects using sequence alignment brought me back here (having completely forgotten that I'd posted a reply to this thread 2 years ago..). See also the following two ARTFL papers &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/conference/programme/abstracts/intertextuality-and-influence-in-the-age-of-enlightenment-sequence-alignment-applications-for-humanities-research.1.html&#34;&#62;one&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/190/235&#34;&#62;two&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You already named two out of three which are the standards. The third is CollateX: &#60;a href=&#34;http://collatex.sourceforge.net/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://collatex.sourceforge.net/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some folks like to use the Versioning Machine: &#60;a href=&#34;http://v-machine.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://v-machine.org/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If your friend is interested in collating really similar images, he/she should check out Sapheos: &#60;a href=&#34;http://sapheos.org/index.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://sapheos.org/index.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For me, collation means similarity as well as difference. Tell your friend mixing it up with matching software provides a different kind of result. I use SuperFastMatch: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mediastandardstrust/superfastmatch&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/mediastandardstrust/superfastmatch&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The important thing is to understand that the algorithm will change the results. Whatever your friend chooses, he/she should be aware of the impact of computational logic on his comparisons. Hope that helps!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For a friend who is studying the manuscripts of John Selden, can anyone recommend collation software?  I see that Collate is still in use, and &#60;a href=&#34;http://juxtasoftware.org&#34;&#62;Juxta&#60;/a&#62; looks promising.  Learning of related projects that use the tool and share techniques would also be helpful.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is the subject of a lot of my current research. The suggestions above are good places to start. I would add the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.juxtasoftware.org/&#34;&#62;Juxta&#60;/a&#62; tool to the mix. Like Ridolfo's, this is a DIFF solution. With texts where the traces are minor or have been moved around, the DIFF breaks down. At the moment we are working with an open source plagiarism detector that will run on a 64-bit Linux machine: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mediastandardstrust/superfastmatch&#34;&#62;SuperFastMatch&#60;/a&#62;. There is no easy web solution yet because of the nature of the computation. The SuperFastMatch library needs all resources in one PC for example. Hope this helps.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hmm. For 1a) you should be able to use the Unix/Linux/OS X terminal tool diff to compare the files. For 1b) you might be able to import the texts into SQL and then do something more complex with mysqldiff. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For 2) you might want to contact MATRIX re: this project: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/2009/12/digging-into-data-challenge-grant-awarded-to-matrix/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/2009/12/digging-into-data-challenge-grant-awarded-to-matrix/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You may find this article on sequence alignment in large text corpora by the folks at ARTFL (&#60;a href=&#34;http://artfl-project.uchicago.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://artfl-project.uchicago.edu/&#60;/a&#62;) useful &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/190/235&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/190/235&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The software ARTFL uses is freely available but its set-up and use remains fairly challenging and has a steep learning curve. Still, the ARTFL team is nothing if not friendly and would, I'm sure, be willing to jump in and assist if you think their tools would be of use for your project as well.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I want to do two different sorts of text comparison, though I suspect the answer for one will apply for the other. Ideally, I'll find a web-based or freeware solution to one or both of the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1. I want to see how much of an early text (a published article, in this case) was lifted and republished in a later one (a book chapter). Being able to find verbatim reuse of paragraphs, sentences, or even strings of words (&#38;gt;5 or so) would be very useful. Both texts have already been identified (i.e. I don't need to search across texts to find candidates for comparison - though that would be nice for the future!), and the ultimate goal is to highlight, in the more recent text, those portions that came from the earlier one. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A side interest (which seems like it would follow from the above) would be to find moments were specific words, examples, or references were swapped out for others. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;2. Expanding on the former, I'd like to be able to take the entire set of texts by a given author published before a certain date and find, as before, portions lifted and republished in a text published on that date (a large book, known to have been cobbled together from previous work, for which the MS is unknown and so finding provenance of various passages has proven laborious). Corpus size is obviously larger here, and representing/listing the relevant portions of lifted text is more complicated because they would each be tagged, ideally, as belonging to specific prior texts. Generating a list of passages from the recent text that listed (a) their location in the new text, (b) the earlier text in which they appeared, and (c) their location in the earlier text would be ideal.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any idea?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Note #1: All the relevant texts are pre-1923 and available in relatively-clean text files (or can be turned into them).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Note #2: I poked around before posting – the closest thread I found is &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-way-to-display-and-compare-multiple-editions-of-a-songbook-on-the-web#post-1224http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-way-to-display-and-compare-multiple-editions-of-a-songbook-on-the-web#post-1224&#34;&#62;this&#60;/a&#62;, though the focus there is music notation.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It pains me to say it, but Rob is right, though I think some exposure to the command line is worth the time it takes. Something like Mallet is fairly advanced, but when I taught an intro to dh this past spring, I did get students to download IBM's word cloud Java app, which is command line only. The interesting side note to this is that students had to sign up with IBM's Developer Works in order to get the app, which also gives them access to the various pieces of Many Eyes, some of whose functionality is hard to replicate elsewhere -- as difficult as it sometimes is to get it to do what you want it to do.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And that, I think, is sort of where we are right now. It often felt like I had a choice between teaching the ideas behind the various analytical possibilities or teaching the mechanics of the tools that could, but with no assurances that they would, realize those possibilities. I like the SEASR model very much, with its notion of graphical piping seeming to offer fairly advanced functionality with a very low entry threshold. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The tools we ended up using most were Jim Dombrowski's Wordij and WordSmith. The down side to WordSmith is that it is proprietary (and it costs $) and it only runs in Windows. The upside is that you can get it to run over a network, and so you can use it across various labs and workstations on a campus; that it's fairly easy to use and for students to &#34;see&#34; results; and that it's popular among corpus linguists and others and so there are established protocols for using it.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Brian, &#60;a href='http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/'&#62;MALLET&#60;/a&#62; would be useful for uncovering different thematic and topic threads and discovering words that are topically correlated to one another.  That said, as a command line tool with no GUI MALLET likely would be more challenging for your students to use than Voyeur and some of the other tools that have been mentioned already.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sounds like fun Brian, but I'm *so* hurt that you didn't include &#60;a href=&#34;http://voyeurtools.org/&#34;&#62;Voyeur Tools&#60;/a&#62; in your preliminary list of text analysis tools to play with... :) You may also want to take a look that the accompanying documentation site on &#60;a href=&#34;http://hermeneuti.ca/voyeur&#34;&#62;Hermeneutica&#60;/a&#62;. Though less stable and not maintained, &#60;a href=&#34;http://hyperpo.org/&#34;&#62;HyperPo&#60;/a&#62; might also be worth a look.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In addition to Katherine's great suggestions, check out Lisa Spiro's &#60;a href=&#34;https://digitalresearchtools.pbworks.com/w/page/17801672/FrontPage&#34;&#62;DiRT&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Meagan Timney taught a course that may have some similarities to what you're doing, you may want to check out her list of &#60;a href=&#34;http://mdouglas.etcl.uvic.ca/huma150/resources&#34;&#62;resources and bibliography&#60;/a&#62; (especially the section on text analysis).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I think it's useful to provide an example of using tools to do interesting things (not just descriptions and theorization of tools and text analysis generally). You might want to consider &#60;a href=&#34;http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/3/361.abstract&#34;&#62;Tanya Clements LLC article on Stein&#60;/a&#62;. A quicker example of rapid analysis (with tools) is something I wrote with Geoffrey Rockwell on the &#60;a href=&#34;http://hermeneuti.ca/rhetoric/now-analyze-that&#34;&#62;Barack Obama and Jeremiah Wright&#60;/a&#62; dust up during 2008 American elections.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Everything I'm writing here makes me think of a dozen others I should mention, so maybe I should just stop there for now and let others chime in.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Brian, I've used TaPoR for a few of my classes to offer data mining (&#60;a href=&#34;http://portal.tapor.ca/portal/portal&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://portal.tapor.ca/portal/portal&#60;/a&#62;) capabilities to, say, Heart of Darkness. We looked cursorily at the recurring use of elephant, tusk, ivory in the novel and were surprised to find that none of these are really prominently used, especially considering that the entire novel is based on the commodification of a living thing.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You might also think about using JUXTA to compare multiple version -- similar to a Hinman Collator (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.juxtasoftware.org/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.juxtasoftware.org/)&#60;/a&#62;. MONK is another good one, but I haven't used it in class yet so I can't attest to its pedagogical efficacy (&#60;a href=&#34;http://gautam.lis.illinois.edu/monkmiddleware/public/index.html)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://gautam.lis.illinois.edu/monkmiddleware/public/index.html)&#60;/a&#62;. TokenX is another great one for visualization (&#60;a href=&#34;http://jetson.unl.edu:8080/cocoon/tokenx/index.html?file=../xml/base.xml)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://jetson.unl.edu:8080/cocoon/tokenx/index.html?file=../xml/base.xml)&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Ok, in terms of readings about textual studies/scholarship, I find that undergraduates fair better when I just explain it to them. If they want to move further into textual scholarship, I have references for them. But reading the big, heavy stuff can be a bit daunting. McGann, Greetham (Textual Scholarship), Tanselle, etc, are the big guns. Might I suggest a book that's geared towards undergraduates and beginning graduate students? Erick Keleman's Textual Editing &#38;amp; Criticism: An Introduction is mighty fine for your purposes (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Textual-Editing-Criticism-Erick-Kelemen/dp/0393929426)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.amazon.com/Textual-Editing-Criticism-Erick-Kelemen/dp/0393929426)&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You might also take a look at my reading schedule for a Materials &#38;amp; Methods grad course that I taught a few years ago; some of the articles might be meaty enough for your purposes but not more than mouthful: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/harris/ResearchMethods/Methods_Intro.htm#sch&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/harris/ResearchMethods/Methods_Intro.htm#sch&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It sounds like what you want to do is build a scholarly edition and then add in some scholarly assessments. We've been fighting a bit about this in the textual realms -- if a crowd-sourced digital edition is the way to go. Ray Siemens, et al. have been working on a format for this (dynamic social edition).  You might read through these two articles for help:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Bertrand Gervais, &#34;Is There a Text on this Screen?&#34; A Companion to Digital Literary Studies&#60;br /&#62;
Ken Price, &#34;Electronic Scholarly Editions,&#34; A Companion to Digital Literary Studies&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Then you might see these about using tools:&#60;br /&#62;
The Babbage Engine&#60;br /&#62;

&#60;p&#62;Two students and I are currently grappling with how to represent a Modernist artist's renderings of some Wilde poetry. We will probably go with Omeka, but we're intending to have this peer reviewed and live on our library servers as a piece of scholarship. (We'd also love to have the page turner plug-in from the Internet Archive but that might be a pipe dream with Omeka.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Bethany, Neil, Ray, Kirstyn, Whitney, Matt K., Steve R., et al might have better/more suggestions too. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Lots of primers on how to create a scholarly edition exist, but I haven't found a really great introduction to building a digital scholarly edition just yet. Please let me know if you do! and please share with us your finalized syllabus.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm super excited to be &#34;Introduction to Digital Humanities&#34; this fall. As I've been turning over the course in my mind, I've known that I've wanted to do one or more projects with the students, probably using our special collections, which tend to be quite strong in particular swaths of literature. This week I sat down with &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/LizChaseMARBL&#34;&#62;Liz Chase&#60;/a&#62;, one of our special collections librarians, and brainstormed. We came up with a great project involving &#60;a href=&#34;http://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/duffy834/?keywords=duffy&#34;&#62;our holdings of Carol Ann Duffy's notebooks&#60;/a&#62;. In short, we want to do some comparisons between how she writes in her 1999 volume, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Wife-Carol-Ann-Duffy/dp/057119995X/briacrox-20&#34;&#62;The World's Wife&#60;/a&#62;, and her previous volumes. We're interested in thematic material, vocabulary she uses, poetic styles, and so forth. But as I've been working to design the project, I've come to realize that the students' work (to say nothing of my teaching) will be improved by the inclusion of some readings on textual scholarship along these lines. &#60;strong&#62;But I don't know this field at all.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What's more, I've been trying to think about what sort of software we might most profitably use to help push our analysis after creating a dataset of the texts. I'm guessing we'll want to represent word counts, word clouds, line structures, and more. My first thought is &#60;a href=&#34;http://seasr.org/&#34;&#62;SEASR&#60;/a&#62;, but I'm not familiar with the tool and I'm not sure if it's overkill or underkill or totally off the mark. I can always use &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.wordle.net/&#34;&#62;Wordle&#60;/a&#62;, but I would like to have more options. And perhaps if I really knew this field of scholarship then it would be easier for me to know which tools I should be using.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What I really need, then, is a suggestion of books or articles that I should read so that our class proceeds thoughtfully on the project with an understanding of what's been done in the past. Any tool suggestions would be welcome as well.
