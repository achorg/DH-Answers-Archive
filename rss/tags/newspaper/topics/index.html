			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Folks,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm considering a project that is more or less on my own time, and sort of in an area of inquiry that I don't often pursue. Therefore, I hope to get some input on the right toolset to get some work done.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My great grandfather was a newspaper columnist, and his work is currently only available in microfilm and in moldy boxes at my grandmother's house. I would love to get this electronified, even if it's only for our family to use.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Omeka seems like the logical choice for organizing and eventually conveying the archive, but what else can I use to 1) make this as painless as possible and 2) give me a rich set of data for interesting analysis and text mining?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The stack of papers is pretty large -- we're looking at 35 years-worth of daily columns. The kinds of things I'd be interested in tracking would mostly be time-based (i.e. keyed to periods of time like presidencies or other historical events. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I do have some help, in siblings and cousins, for transcriptions or other tedious work, but is there some OCR approach I should consider?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is very much in the &#34;Maybe we could do this ...&#34; phase, so I'd appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks,&#60;br /&#62;
Zach
