			<description>&#60;p&#62;Yes, it's important to stress that the humanities skills *are* an asset to employers. The &#34;tech&#34; knowledge students acquire through DH are on their own an added bonus, but more so in combination with humanities training. I think it's also important to articulate what it is about DH that will help students get a &#34;foot in the door&#34;. Part of this message has to be aimed at administrators/donors so that they will support DH on campus and part of it has to be aimed at students to attract their interest in courses.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Undergraduate degrees in DH are still fairly rare, so in many cases, we're talking about individual courses. At some institutions (mine being one), students may not be able to obtain the kind of breadth you describe through electives, and DH can then play an important access role, allowing students who cannot take (or are intimidated by taking) CS or Stats to obtain some knowledge of these subjects. They may well pick up more than they would in a lower-division course.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Regardless, I think your suggestions are a good start at compiling the list I am looking for. Somewhere in between or around framing socio-economic problems and weighing alternate hypotheses, I'd add addressing those problems through technological solutions.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Good question! I've been thinking about this a lot. I think we can start by giving full credit to the traditional humanistic side. I worked in the private sector before going to grad school (as a technical writer and a bit as a developer), and I recall that the scarcest resources were not technical know-how but clear organization and communication. In theory, those are things we teach in the humanities -- although probably we don't do as much group/project work as we should. But anyway, I can totally see a path to &#34;project manager&#34; or &#34;technical writer&#34; for undergraduates with (some) technical and (good) verbal skills.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A little more ambitiously, there are a lot of private-sector data-analysis jobs where domain savvy + basic quantitative chops are more important than an ability to optimize C++. Business intelligence, marketing, consulting, etc. I think a student could get a foot in that sort of door by demonstrating some basic data-mining and visualization skills, plus a really strong ability to frame socio-economic problems and weigh alternate hypotheses.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Probably there are other niches that make better use of humanities-specific skills. But honestly if I were advising an undergrad right now, I wouldn't be pushing DH-qua-DH so much as I would be pushing *breadth.* I think they should take Econ as well as History and English and CS and Stats.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This isn't really a specific question, but more of a conversation starter. I've been looking around for a well-articulated statement of the transferable skills students acquire in studying digital humanities, above and beyond, and in combination with traditional humanities skills. As we try to transfer DH research culture to the undergraduate classroom, it seems to me increasingly important to make a case that studying DH provides skills that are in demand by employers--and that give graduates a leg up in the job market--but one especially geared towards undergraduate, the majority of whom are not going to pursue graduate school. I think many of us treat the advantages as self-evident: coding skills, data analysis, project management, to name a few types of knowledge not emphasised in the traditional humanities. These are all skills in demand. But the undergraduate DH student is not likely to be competitive with one in computer scientist for a software engineering job. Is there a special niche for the humanities students with a DH background?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thoughts or resources are greatly appreciated.

&#60;p&#62;I hear you on this; and I don't think it has to be. It's as much teaching undergraduates* how to use the already effective tools that are out there -- how 18th century English Lit studies are changed by the accessibility of ECCO, EEBO, and the Burney Collection,** for example.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;*And even graduate students, staff, faculty, in some cases.&#60;br /&#62;
**Not that I'm blithely assuming that all colleges and unis have access to these tools.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I agree with you that interpretations of textual, visual, geographical, archaeological, etc. data within the humanities are digital humanities.  Almost everything I have done professionally or academically over the last six years has been DH, from GIS to 3D visualization to cultural heritage informatics.  I'm not going split hairs as to whether TEI and data mining are web-based or not, but I find myself increasingly frustrated by conversations about &#34;How do we teach/introduce students to DH,&#34; and all of the answers relate to some form of web development: designing a database schema, learning HTML/CSS.  These are things that are of limited usefulness in many humanities disciplines.  I understand that people will suggest skills based on their own experience, but DH is losing out a lot of experienced technologists and scholars from non-textual fields, and as I have observed DH becoming more and more narrowly focused, voices in the textual humanities fields have greater and greater influence (control, even) over what is or is not &#34;Digital Humanities.&#34;  That is why I suggest that people who call themselves digital humanists ought to reconsider their notion of DH.  I think the field is much bigger than they realize, and thus needs to be more inclusive.

&#60;p&#62;I have to say, I disagree with most, if not all, of this. There is plenty of coding work in DH that is not web-related. Text-mining and distant reading are examples, as is work encoding texts in TEI. I think I remember some very awesome visualizations of ancient architecture, too, that I would call non-web DH coding? :)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The thing that I disagree with most is the idea that we (counting myself as a digital humanist) need to rethink our notion of the Digital Humanities. Like the #transformDH hashtag, it is predicated on a set idea of DH that I do not think exists. It seems like less than a year ago that there was still very active discussion about the role of code in DH, what skills could/should be part of it, and how it all fits together. No one, I think, ever came up with a notion of DH that had widespread consensus as being a good definition. Now, it seems, we are chasing after responses to a non-existent notion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, I do see the existence of two branches of DH, with different histories. In broad strokes, one is the &#34;Humanities Computing&#34; branch, on is indeed the more web-oriented branch (which shares more in common with ed tech). This has been recounted many times before, sometimes in this very site.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd ask that we all recognize the youth of DH, and this it is -- whatever it is! -- still developing through informal channels like THATCamps and blogs and twitter conversation, and through the institutional decisions made by administrators and through cluster hires. In short, I think it is far too early to say that DH is far too focused on textual disciplines. It might be at present, but the ultimate constitution of DH is still very much to be determined. Awesome visualization and interpretation of data -- textual, architectual, visual, geographical, temporal, archaeological, and more -- through digital/code-based means can and should be part of DH. I consider it to be implicit that it _is_, but maybe hasn't had as much attention as other aspects. Seems parallel to the Theory and DH questions that way?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Is learning to code even important in Digital Humanities?  I argue that it's not.  There are particular technologies that are relevant to various disciplines in the humanities, and web development isn't necessarily one of them (since coding always refers to web development in DH contexts).  Digital Humanities, capital D capital H, is far too focused on the textual disciplines and hardly inclusive of the humanities as a whole.  Digital Humanists ought to reconsider their notion of the Digital Humanities.  If you wonder why computer scientists are reluctant to get involved in Capital D Capital H, it's for this reason.  There are actually a great many computer scientists involved elsewhere in the humanities.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for all the great answers!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To update this forum, two of the respondents (Brian Croxall and Jeff McClurken) along with Ryan Cordell spoke about &#34;Teaching DH 101: Introduction to the Digital Humanities&#34; for NITLE's Digital Scholarship Seminars in December.  You can access the recording from the event website:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This seminar prompted a couple of posts on the NITLE blog because the presenters didn't really address coding for undergrads.  Here are a couple of posts that adress that issue:&#60;br /&#62;
Can Humanities Undergrads Learn to Code? by undergrads who learned to code in a humanities course at Pitt &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#60;/a&#62; (The answer is yes!!)&#60;br /&#62;
More Coding for Humanities Undergrads by Kathryn Tomasek, Wheaton College (again yes!!) &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#60;/a&#62;

&#60;p&#62;So these are perhaps unsurprising suggestions given our mutual UVA pedigree, but I think something of Jerome McGann's makes a lot of sense. I know folks have actually used games of IVANHOE (played in class, on paper, or via blogs) with some success (though I'm too timid to do that). Something from &#60;em&#62;Radiant Textuality&#60;/em&#62; makes sense. These pieces are available online:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/jjm2f/blackwell.htm&#34;&#62;Marking Texts in Many Dimensions&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/jjm2f/old/deform.html&#34;&#62;Deformance and Interpretation&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;&#60;strong&#62;EDIT:&#60;/strong&#62; Added five minutes later when this, also rather unoriginal, thought occurred to me:&#60;/em&#62; Something from Franco Moretti's &#60;em&#62;Graphs, Maps, and Trees&#60;/em&#62; could work well I think (or even the whole book; it is delightfully short).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This spring I'm teaching a survey of literary criticism. We need to cover many of the major movements during the semester, and I will only have 1 week to devote to DH. I do, however, want my students to be aware of this increasingly influential field--and, of course, the field I'm most interested in myself.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What 2-3 articles would you include in such a survey? They'd need to be fairly broad--for students who aren't necessarily interested in DH (at least not yet). Stephen Ramsay's &#34;Algorithmic Criticism&#34; (&#60;a href=&#34;http://tiny.cc/d81s6&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://tiny.cc/d81s6&#60;/a&#62;) was suggested on Twitter. Other ideas?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Hope,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Another option would be to have your students do close reading using XML, but not necessarily TEI.  This gets them encoding much faster. They can still look at TEI for examples of what people tend to care about encoding, and juxtapose it with their own markup/editorial decisions. Some interesting discussions can flow from that.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I taught text encoding at a &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcampnewengland.org/&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62; a few weeks ago. Not much you can do in 75 minutes, but even in that short time workshop attendees had the chance to wrap their minds around the basic concepts and start asking quite sophisticated questions.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Other examples of using idiosyncratic XML for close reading include &#60;a href=&#34;http://golf.services.brown.edu/projects/VHL/&#34;&#62;Virtual Humanities Lab&#60;/a&#62; (see the FAQ, and the Esposizioni and Cronica in particular) and &#60;a href=&#34;http://rolandht.org/&#34;&#62;RolandHT&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've done this previously but as a method of teaching markup rather than close reading of a text, usually with a short and unproblematic poem in any case.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For example in our TEI Summer School in Oxford in 2010 we used In Flanders Fields for markup practice with exercises on metadata and transcription phenomenon. &#60;a href=&#34;http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Oxford/2010-07-oxford/&#34;&#62;http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Oxford/2010-07-oxford/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I think the approach though, of having students do close reading by teaching them some basic markup and having them markup and discuss the textual problems in the text at hand.  What you end up teaching them is more than close reading, it is editorial theory, perhaps philology, and a bit about metadata which feeds into their knowledge about proper referencing and citation.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Alex Gil and I are working with Jerome McGann to do some TEI markup of a number of different versions of two poems by Emily Dickinson in an undergraduate poetry class this semester. We're writing about process as we go at &#60;a href=&#34;http://tangouva.wordpress.com&#34;&#62;http://tangouva.wordpress.com&#60;/a&#62;. We'll be posting more about this experience (particularly the TEI stuff) in coming weeks.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I wouldn't say that we used &#34;TEI encoding to do a close reading&#34;; our chief interest has been using TEI as a way to capture the complexities of a single poem's textual history and to introduce students to aspects of literary study which undergraduate education rarely covers. I do think, though, that close reading skills are indispensable when using TEI in this way and in using TEI in the classroom more generally. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For our purposes, comparing multiple witnesses to the manuscript and print history of a single poem, we are interested in how apparently minor changes (the presence or absence of line indentation; changes in punctuation and capitalization; changes in a poem's title) can affect what and &#60;em&#62;how&#60;/em&#62; a poem means. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The result is a close reading focused not on semantic or linguistic aspects of the verse (&#34;Why this word?&#34; &#34;What does this repetition suggest?&#34;) but on the various ways in which a &#34;single poem&#34; gets represented, how it enters print, and on its &#60;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=uwNGEc_2FQ8C&#38;amp;lpg=PA57&#38;amp;dq=%22bibliographical%20codes%22%20mcgann&#38;amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&#38;amp;q&#38;amp;f=false&#34;&#62;&#34;bibliographical codes&#34;&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Because the question one faces when moving a poem from paper to TEI is always &#34;What to mark up?&#34; I think this exercise is particularly useful for highlighting the importance of such bibliographical codes. I would be interested, though, in hearing how other folks might use TEI to do a more traditional sort of close reading.
