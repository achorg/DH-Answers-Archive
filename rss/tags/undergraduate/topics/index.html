			<description>&#60;p&#62;This isn't really a specific question, but more of a conversation starter. I've been looking around for a well-articulated statement of the transferable skills students acquire in studying digital humanities, above and beyond, and in combination with traditional humanities skills. As we try to transfer DH research culture to the undergraduate classroom, it seems to me increasingly important to make a case that studying DH provides skills that are in demand by employers--and that give graduates a leg up in the job market--but one especially geared towards undergraduate, the majority of whom are not going to pursue graduate school. I think many of us treat the advantages as self-evident: coding skills, data analysis, project management, to name a few types of knowledge not emphasised in the traditional humanities. These are all skills in demand. But the undergraduate DH student is not likely to be competitive with one in computer scientist for a software engineering job. Is there a special niche for the humanities students with a DH background?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thoughts or resources are greatly appreciated.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have specific examples of assignments that use TEI encoding to do a close reading of a text? The assignment, the results or general comments about how that could be structured, or if it did work with students, would be appreciated.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This spring I'm teaching a survey of literary criticism. We need to cover many of the major movements during the semester, and I will only have 1 week to devote to DH. I do, however, want my students to be aware of this increasingly influential field--and, of course, the field I'm most interested in myself.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What 2-3 articles would you include in such a survey? They'd need to be fairly broad--for students who aren't necessarily interested in DH (at least not yet). Stephen Ramsay's &#34;Algorithmic Criticism&#34; (&#60;a href=&#34;http://tiny.cc/d81s6&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://tiny.cc/d81s6&#60;/a&#62;) was suggested on Twitter. Other ideas?
