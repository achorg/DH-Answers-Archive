			<description>&#60;p&#62;Further to &#60;em&#62;@Joe Wicentowski's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/alternatives-to-cocoon#post-537&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/em&#62; mentioning &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/&#34;&#62;XProc&#60;/a&#62;, you could use a batch-mode XProc processor such as &#60;a href=&#34;http://xmlcalabash.com/&#34;&#62;XML Calabash&#60;/a&#62; to pre-build the HTML website. If you're familiar with Cocoon and writing pipelines, you'll find XProc is similar and easy to pick up.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear all,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks very much for your comments, which are extremely helpful in trying to better work out what I want to do - a copy of 'Map Scripting 101' is heading my way!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks again, and all I need to do now is finish the proposal...&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;all the best,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Tim

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We've been plotting sea voyages - specifically the Beagle - using Google Maps and Simile Timeline with data recorded in Heurist (heuristscholar.org). You can see an example at &#60;a href=&#34;http://heuristscholar.org/cocoon/anmm/item/1225/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://heuristscholar.org/cocoon/anmm/item/1225/&#60;/a&#62; (log in with guest+guest). On the right you have the resources linked to that particular section, including previous and next sections, images and the voyage as a whole (which itself is linked back to all the sections in voyage order). The underlying database is a collaborative web-based object database built on MySQL/PHP. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The pages are built from Heurist records and relationships which generate XML which is  processed with XSLT and Cocoon. This is rather an old experimental version of our Relationship Browser view - some of it is broken and the map/timeline layout is poor. This capability is now embedded directly in the Heurist front-end (Vsn 3, due out early next year). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For a more finished system which uses the same XML/XSLT/Cocoon relationship browser technology see &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/place/hyde_park_barracks&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/place/hyde_park_barracks&#60;/a&#62; - the navigation, map, timeline, images etc. are generated in the same way from Heurist relationships.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Tim,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Check the examples and tutorials at &#60;a HREF=&#34;http://www.googlelittrips.org/&#34;&#62;Google Lit Trips&#60;/a&#62; to see how others have used Google Earth to document travel, both on land and sea. You can embed as much information as you want on individuals involved in the journey, dates, ship info, and such in the KML so it's available interactively to your user when they click icons on the map.  And it's easy to share your work with others through KML/KMZ files.  If this looks appealing, download one of the .kml files from the site and use it as a model for your project. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And here's a fun read on how to document an ocean voyage, now in progress: &#60;a HREF=&#34;http://www.tahinaexpedition.com/&#34;&#62;Tahina Expedition&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The folks over at the Hagley Museum (Dupont) used VisualEyes to track early 19th century sales of gunpowder:&#60;/p&#62;

&#60;p&#62;I think they tracked over 8,000 individual sales from archive records.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you seek for a web-based solution, the recently published &#34;Map Scripting 101&#34;, &#34;an Example-Driven Guide to Building Interactive Maps with Bing, Yahoo!, and Google Maps&#60;br /&#62;
by Adam DuVander (&#60;a href=&#34;http://nostarch.com/mapscripting.htm&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://nostarch.com/mapscripting.htm&#60;/a&#62;) might be a starting point.&#60;br /&#62;
A desktop-solution would be using Google Earth or NASA World Wind.&#60;br /&#62;
KML would probably the &#34;language&#34; to use, as it is an open standard and can also serve as a datasource. Cf. example the work of the colleagues at Stanford  &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.stanford.edu/dept/humbio/googleMaps/Voyage_of_the_Beagle.kmz&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.stanford.edu/dept/humbio/googleMaps/Voyage_of_the_Beagle.kmz&#60;/a&#62; (Link should open in Google Earth)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello there,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As part of a proposed project I have in mind to create a digital map, showing multiple sea journeys - i.e. information upon the individuals involved in that journey, the dates it began and ended, the name of the ship, and to plot it route on the map. Most journeys begin in eastern Australia, but the destinations are global.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've had a brief play around with Google Maps which might suit the purpose, but doesn't seem ideal for working with sea journeys or the amount of data I plan to input for each voyage. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Is anyone aware of any software which might be a better fit?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for your help, and apologies for my ignorance.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Tim
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A bit late here, but let me echo James in suggesting &#60;a href=&#34;http://exist-db.org&#34;&#62;eXist&#60;/a&#62; - it supports XSLT, XQuery, XProc, etc. (the major ways of querying and transforming documents), has powerful full text search of your XML, flexible URL rewriting and comes with the lightweight Jetty webserver (no Cocoon necessary).  The site I work on, &#60;a href=&#34;http://history.state.gov&#34;&#62;history.state.gov&#60;/a&#62;, is pure eXist + XQuery + TEI.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The big problem with most of the functional language implementations for XSL is at some point they all rely on the underlying C libraries (libxml, libxslt). You'll see this limitation for XSLT 2.0 transforms, you're limited to using Saxon and it's supported libraries (Java and .Net). Really you're really left with two options if you want to use a functional language in your app, you're kind of limited to either jRuby (or something funky like LIFT or Clojure) or pre-processing the partial views. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, there is a partial C library for the XSLT 2 spec called libX (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.explain.com.au/libx/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.explain.com.au/libx/)&#60;/a&#62;. If this project takes off, you could very easily write a wrapper in PECL, Ruby, or Swig to expose this functionality to the different languages. But it's not there yet. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What I would encourage you to also look at is some automated workflows. There are some heavy-weight options (e.g. BPEL), but also some pretty light options (see &#60;a href=&#34;http://github.com/jmettraux/ruote)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://github.com/jmettraux/ruote)&#60;/a&#62; that go a long way in helping you establish a sane, sustainable, and ultimately transferable method of ingesting and disseminating content, independent of what front-end technology is chosen.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Been meaning to respond to this also, co-worker of Karin's. Has anyone looked into any methods using python? I'm interested in changing some of the tools we use (for example, instead of using PHP --ugh -- I'd like it if we used Python/Ruby by default), so I'm trying to figure out some issues related to how we currently do things that may come up if we do that.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm curious (entirely ignoring the previous paragraph), it would be useful for some things we've done to be able to run xslt 2.0 functions in php. I've seen and heard JavaBridge is an option (though my experience so far has been the same as Wayne's), does anyone know of any other options? I can think of a few ways that might work, but nothing as elegant as JavaBridge at least purports to be (not that it even comes close!).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Some of our old, XSLT 1.0 sites have been transformed using a simple PHP transformation (I believe that is how The Journals of Lewis and Clark Expedition - &#60;a href=&#34;http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/&#60;/a&#62; - is currently being handled) but our newer sites use XSLT 2.0 features. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I may just make an effort to restrict myself to XSLT 1.0 for our simple projects in the future. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks everyone for your wonderful responses! I have a lot to look into.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It depends on a developer's needs really.  I have used Cocoon extensively, eXist, various CMSes, etc. If what you really need is just quite simple dynamic transformation from XML to HTML and not all the bells and whistles of a CMS there are much simpler routes one can take.  I have a need for a basic virtual URL remapper with dynamic transformations.  None of this needs the complexity of any of the above methods.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For example:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.oucs.ox.ac.uk/jamesc/2010/08/19/simple-dynamic-transformation-of-xml-with-htaccess-php-and-xslt/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.oucs.ox.ac.uk/jamesc/2010/08/19/simple-dynamic-transformation-of-xml-with-htaccess-php-and-xslt/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
shows one method of doing basic (sadly limited to XSLT1) dynamic transformations using just .htaccess and a really short php file that just says &#34;transform this XML with this XSLT&#34;. The control of which XML/XSLT combination a particular URL gets is done entirely in the .htaccess file.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What this can't do... well it could be not very prettily... is a long series of pipelined transformations. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;However, one benefit of this kind of approach is that basic php and .htaccess are available on almost all shared hosting platforms where you might not have the ability or access to install other solutions.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Just my two pence,&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you're feeling adventurous and want to integrate the TEI documents into a &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.radiantcms.org/&#34;&#62;Radiant CMS&#60;/a&#62;, then you might want to look at &#60;a href=&#34;http://github.com/jgsmith/radiant-tei-tools&#34;&#62;http://github.com/jgsmith/radiant-tei-tools&#60;/a&#62; as an example of how to create a filter or Radiant tag that will transform the TEI document into HTML.  This approach lets you treat the TEI documents as pages in the CMS.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If there's any interest in the Radiant extension, I'll try to update it with what I have working in production right now -- I've been focused on a lot of other stuff lately.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I can't believe I forgot this, but there's also a plugin for Omeka (see &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/TeiDisplay)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/TeiDisplay)&#60;/a&#62; which can substitute for some of these other systems with TEI documents. Definitely another project to check out (and give us feedback). Particularly useful with the Omeka SolrSearch plugin (&#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/SolrSearch)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/SolrSearch)&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In the rails stuff, I've built rake tasks that I can call through the capistrano deployment (e.g. cap production deploy calls rake render:pre-render and rake render:gen_navigation). Essentially I just didn't have to even think of it, I let the system do the heavy lifting.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Javabridge was a complete disaster. This was a few years ago, and the project has progressed, but at least on the RHEL 5 boxes I was using, it was unstable enough that I completely abandoned it. In the Zend Framework, there are some bridge-ish things (e.g. the Lucene indexer), but after some discussions with the Omeka developers, this was a bit of a disaster for them as there seemed to be a hard limit of items you could have in a collection before seeing significant performance degredation. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I will say that the Faulkner-Audio-Collection could/should be patched to do the on-the-fly transforms to improve the workflow, then, at deploy time, use an appropriate caching mechanism to minimize the CPU load on big XSLT transforms.
