			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm wondering if any of you folks would be willing to share custom (software or content) licenses as well as IP agreements for your DH projects. I'm especially interested in what licenses people are using for code and why, as well as IP agreements that are used with research assistants, staff and other researchers. I'll post a few examples that we've used in a separate message below, but I'd be grateful to hear what others have been doing and why (as applicable).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm working on an Omeka project with a class, and am concerned about the kinds of images we might be able to include with our item records. The class is about popular culture and childhood, and the students are nominating for inclusion (&#38;amp; writing item records about) objects that were significant to their own experiences with pop cult as kids; this results in an archive full of items like Jersey Shore and Harry Potter which are very much still in copyright. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know this isn't the right forum for specific questions about copyright, but is there someplace I could turn to get some feedback about this project? I've often wondered whether there might be some entity out there that would offer pro bono advice to people working in education who are worried about committing inadvertent copyright violations.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks.&#60;br /&#62;
Rebecca
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

				<title>Paige Morgan on "best practices for sharing TEI code and public/private data dictionaries"</title>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working on a long-term database project involving literature and economics, in which I'm gathering price data from a wide range of 18th and 19th century English texts.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;On my project website, I have an editorial statement and FAQ designed to provide context for the project both for people who are familiar with lit./econ. studies, and less so. I don't want to give away my IP, so most of the project itself is walled off. But I'm at the stage where I'm going to be looking for interested collaborators, and so I'd like to put as much on display as possible while protecting my work. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With that in mind, I'm trying to make a decision about whether to share a sample entry with full TEI markup. It's important, I think, that I show how my work uses the current TEI guidelines; especially because in a couple of areas, I'm extending them to meet the needs of my data. That brings me to the data dictionary, and the question of whether to make it visible, so that people can see my rationale for the choices I've made.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I could password protect some parts of the site, and maintain a certain amount of control over who can access it that way, but that doesn't provide a lot of security, and to be truthful, I'd prefer to have the site open, so that someone who found it could explore without having to contact me first.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I looked back through previous posts, and though I found acknowledgments that code is often kept out of the public eye, I didn't find any clear statements regarding the fine balance between making code public as a way of illustrating that you know what you're doing; and sharing too much.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Anyone have any recommendations? And thanks, very much, in advance.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
