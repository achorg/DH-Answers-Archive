&#60;p&#62;We can ask many questions of that project. One that we're particularly interested in the small group we have going at Columbia U. is to figure out how canons are formed through pedagogical practices in the academy. Topic modeling also comes to mind as a possible approach. Of course, revisiting the million syllabi project properly would concern itself with problems larger than data mining questions. We are interested, for example and all obstacles aside for now, to have a resource that teachers can access to stay abreast of curricular developments. I hope we get more buy-in in this thread to see how others are thinking about Cohen's project.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd be interested in joining in that group. I guess my problem is that I don't quite know what questions to ask. What do I need to learn to be able to dig into that data? I think that MySQL stuff is involved, but I really am not sure.

&#60;p&#62;Hi, Ian. Thanks for asking this question. I'm very interested in forming a working group for folks who want to revisit Dan Cohen's millio syllabi project. I'm very curious to see what kinds of answers you get here, but also to see who would be interested in participating in such a group.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have some ideas for different projects involving the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dancohen.org/2011/03/30/a-million-syllabi/&#34;&#62;million syllabi&#60;/a&#62; that Dan Cohen collected but I'm not sure where to start. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know some of you have done work on that data already and I'm hoping you can point me in the right direction to start.

&#60;p&#62;I hear you on this; and I don't think it has to be. It's as much teaching undergraduates* how to use the already effective tools that are out there -- how 18th century English Lit studies are changed by the accessibility of ECCO, EEBO, and the Burney Collection,** for example.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;*And even graduate students, staff, faculty, in some cases.&#60;br /&#62;
**Not that I'm blithely assuming that all colleges and unis have access to these tools.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I agree with you that interpretations of textual, visual, geographical, archaeological, etc. data within the humanities are digital humanities.  Almost everything I have done professionally or academically over the last six years has been DH, from GIS to 3D visualization to cultural heritage informatics.  I'm not going split hairs as to whether TEI and data mining are web-based or not, but I find myself increasingly frustrated by conversations about &#34;How do we teach/introduce students to DH,&#34; and all of the answers relate to some form of web development: designing a database schema, learning HTML/CSS.  These are things that are of limited usefulness in many humanities disciplines.  I understand that people will suggest skills based on their own experience, but DH is losing out a lot of experienced technologists and scholars from non-textual fields, and as I have observed DH becoming more and more narrowly focused, voices in the textual humanities fields have greater and greater influence (control, even) over what is or is not &#34;Digital Humanities.&#34;  That is why I suggest that people who call themselves digital humanists ought to reconsider their notion of DH.  I think the field is much bigger than they realize, and thus needs to be more inclusive.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Ethan Gruber's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-do-we-introduce-undergraduates-to-the-digital-humanities/page/2#post-1583&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have to say, I disagree with most, if not all, of this. There is plenty of coding work in DH that is not web-related. Text-mining and distant reading are examples, as is work encoding texts in TEI. I think I remember some very awesome visualizations of ancient architecture, too, that I would call non-web DH coding? :)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The thing that I disagree with most is the idea that we (counting myself as a digital humanist) need to rethink our notion of the Digital Humanities. Like the #transformDH hashtag, it is predicated on a set idea of DH that I do not think exists. It seems like less than a year ago that there was still very active discussion about the role of code in DH, what skills could/should be part of it, and how it all fits together. No one, I think, ever came up with a notion of DH that had widespread consensus as being a good definition. Now, it seems, we are chasing after responses to a non-existent notion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, I do see the existence of two branches of DH, with different histories. In broad strokes, one is the &#34;Humanities Computing&#34; branch, on is indeed the more web-oriented branch (which shares more in common with ed tech). This has been recounted many times before, sometimes in this very site.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd ask that we all recognize the youth of DH, and this it is -- whatever it is! -- still developing through informal channels like THATCamps and blogs and twitter conversation, and through the institutional decisions made by administrators and through cluster hires. In short, I think it is far too early to say that DH is far too focused on textual disciplines. It might be at present, but the ultimate constitution of DH is still very much to be determined. Awesome visualization and interpretation of data -- textual, architectual, visual, geographical, temporal, archaeological, and more -- through digital/code-based means can and should be part of DH. I consider it to be implicit that it _is_, but maybe hasn't had as much attention as other aspects. Seems parallel to the Theory and DH questions that way?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Is learning to code even important in Digital Humanities?  I argue that it's not.  There are particular technologies that are relevant to various disciplines in the humanities, and web development isn't necessarily one of them (since coding always refers to web development in DH contexts).  Digital Humanities, capital D capital H, is far too focused on the textual disciplines and hardly inclusive of the humanities as a whole.  Digital Humanists ought to reconsider their notion of the Digital Humanities.  If you wonder why computer scientists are reluctant to get involved in Capital D Capital H, it's for this reason.  There are actually a great many computer scientists involved elsewhere in the humanities.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for all the great answers!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To update this forum, two of the respondents (Brian Croxall and Jeff McClurken) along with Ryan Cordell spoke about &#34;Teaching DH 101: Introduction to the Digital Humanities&#34; for NITLE's Digital Scholarship Seminars in December.  You can access the recording from the event website:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This seminar prompted a couple of posts on the NITLE blog because the presenters didn't really address coding for undergrads.  Here are a couple of posts that adress that issue:&#60;br /&#62;
Can Humanities Undergrads Learn to Code? by undergrads who learned to code in a humanities course at Pitt &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#60;/a&#62; (The answer is yes!!)&#60;br /&#62;
More Coding for Humanities Undergrads by Kathryn Tomasek, Wheaton College (again yes!!) &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Could you ask them to self-assess their levels of knowledge in certain categories you care about? Ideally, you might have given them a pre-activity set of competencies to measure on a &#60;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale&#34;&#62;Likert scale&#60;/a&#62; -- and then asked them to rate themselves on the same scale at the end of the class.  We took that approach for assessment of our NEH &#60;a href=&#34;http://spatial.humanities.org&#34;&#62;advanced-topics workshops on GIS&#60;/a&#62; and were really happy with the data.  But you might even get interesting results by asking them &#60;em&#62;now&#60;/em&#62; to place themselves &#34;before and after&#34; on a scale -- from clueless to expert? -- in your five established categories of work.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're coming to the close of a student digitization project and would like to have them fill out a short, simple, anonymous survey about their experience. The class is a first-year history class (17 students, seminar style) titled American Women's History. The project involved choosing materials from our library Special Collections about a specific person (Consuelo Northrup Bailey), scanning the documents (mostly letters), transcribing them, encoding them (TEI), researching her life, then building an Omeka exhibit that describes the arch of her life and career in the context of the themes of the course. The project involved 5 class sessions where most of the work was done, and will be worth 25% of their grade.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We want to find out if they enjoyed the project (especially as it was not written into the course description that they saw when they registered!) and if they have any suggestions. We hope to use their responses to support additional similar projects next semester while building a workable process, and handbook, for integrating more of these types of projects into other courses.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The kinds of questions I'm considering are roughly:&#60;br /&#62;
  - Did you enjoy the project?&#60;br /&#62;
  - The project was divided into five sections: scanning, transcribing, encoding, researching, building the exhibit. Of the five which did you find the easiest/hardest? most interesting/least interesting? had enough time/not enough time?&#60;br /&#62;
  - If you had a choice between two versions of the same course, one with this type of project and one with a more traditional research paper, which would you choose?&#60;br /&#62;
  - Consider the amount of work you put into this project. What would you equate that to in a more traditional project/assignment? (a 5-7 page research paper, a 10-13 page research paper? studying for an exam, a ...?&#60;br /&#62;
  - an open question like: what would you do differently, what would you like to more of or some such.&#60;br /&#62;
  - a question related to the choice of topic: would you prefer to choose your own subject...?&#60;br /&#62;
  - what else???&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Has anyone done this type of survey or have suggestions for questions? And as long as we're about it, do you have any questions you would like me to ask the students? I'd be happy to share the data once done.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;- Hope

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hey, thanks, everybody (especially Patrick, who is now officially the fairy godfather for this project, having also helped me on the technical side over at Omeka). I will dig through all of this. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The question of how far down the copyright rabbit hole to take the students in a good one. I was planning on selecting their images myself this semester, given that we're already spending a lot of time in my class on &#34;extra&#34; instruction that's not teaching them the content on the syllabus. (I taught them Zotero, made them use databases for their research, and am requiring them to write these weird-to-them archive entries instead of traditional papers, which is already a tall order for some of them - there are a lot of freshmen in the class - as well as a tall order for me, as an early-career instructor.) I might make this part of the assignment next semester, however. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I may also include on the site a written statement that summarizes my rationale for claiming fair use for the images that I use (I mean, if I pick any that are questionable, which seems inevitable). I'm not sure how much protection that will provide, but I thought I'd seen something similar elsewhere. If anybody has good examples of this, or feedback re: whether this is a good idea, I'd love to hear it.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Rebecca, you might try asking either your campus legal office (I've dealt with campus legal at two-three different institutions, and they've always been fantastic) or at your campus library (which may have a copyright expert internally).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Is the Omeka project live on the web, or on a private server? The answer may impact the strength of a fair-use analysis. (IANAL, TINLA.)
