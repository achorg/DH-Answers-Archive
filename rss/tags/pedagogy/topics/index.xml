			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have some ideas for different projects involving the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.dancohen.org/2011/03/30/a-million-syllabi/&#34;&#62;million syllabi&#60;/a&#62; that Dan Cohen collected but I'm not sure where to start. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know some of you have done work on that data already and I'm hoping you can point me in the right direction to start.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have specific examples of assignments that use TEI encoding to do a close reading of a text? The assignment, the results or general comments about how that could be structured, or if it did work with students, would be appreciated.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're coming to the close of a student digitization project and would like to have them fill out a short, simple, anonymous survey about their experience. The class is a first-year history class (17 students, seminar style) titled American Women's History. The project involved choosing materials from our library Special Collections about a specific person (Consuelo Northrup Bailey), scanning the documents (mostly letters), transcribing them, encoding them (TEI), researching her life, then building an Omeka exhibit that describes the arch of her life and career in the context of the themes of the course. The project involved 5 class sessions where most of the work was done, and will be worth 25% of their grade.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We want to find out if they enjoyed the project (especially as it was not written into the course description that they saw when they registered!) and if they have any suggestions. We hope to use their responses to support additional similar projects next semester while building a workable process, and handbook, for integrating more of these types of projects into other courses.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The kinds of questions I'm considering are roughly:&#60;br /&#62;
  - Did you enjoy the project?&#60;br /&#62;
  - The project was divided into five sections: scanning, transcribing, encoding, researching, building the exhibit. Of the five which did you find the easiest/hardest? most interesting/least interesting? had enough time/not enough time?&#60;br /&#62;
  - If you had a choice between two versions of the same course, one with this type of project and one with a more traditional research paper, which would you choose?&#60;br /&#62;
  - Consider the amount of work you put into this project. What would you equate that to in a more traditional project/assignment? (a 5-7 page research paper, a 10-13 page research paper? studying for an exam, a ...?&#60;br /&#62;
  - an open question like: what would you do differently, what would you like to more of or some such.&#60;br /&#62;
  - a question related to the choice of topic: would you prefer to choose your own subject...?&#60;br /&#62;
  - what else???&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Has anyone done this type of survey or have suggestions for questions? And as long as we're about it, do you have any questions you would like me to ask the students? I'd be happy to share the data once done.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;- Hope

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm working on an Omeka project with a class, and am concerned about the kinds of images we might be able to include with our item records. The class is about popular culture and childhood, and the students are nominating for inclusion (&#38;amp; writing item records about) objects that were significant to their own experiences with pop cult as kids; this results in an archive full of items like Jersey Shore and Harry Potter which are very much still in copyright. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I know this isn't the right forum for specific questions about copyright, but is there someplace I could turn to get some feedback about this project? I've often wondered whether there might be some entity out there that would offer pro bono advice to people working in education who are worried about committing inadvertent copyright violations.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks.&#60;br /&#62;
Rebecca
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
