			<description>&#60;p&#62;In unrelated research, I found a tesseract training GUI written by a web developer: &#60;a href=&#34;http://pp19dd.com/2010/09/tesseract-ocr-boxfile-ajax-editor/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://pp19dd.com/2010/09/tesseract-ocr-boxfile-ajax-editor/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
Since I haven't had to train tesseract yet, I'm not entirely confident of reading that page well, but it looks like it might be useful if you find the existing tesseract Arabic data lacking.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It was originally written in 2010, but has been updated for tesseract v3.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

&#60;p&#62;typeset very consistently in the late '50s, but the letters look a little &#34;fancy&#34; and have a lot of very thin lines. I don't read Arabic, so can't describe in more detail.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I haven't used it for this case, but I had some minor POC success with &#60;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/&#34;&#62;Tesseract&#60;/a&#62;. It was non-trivial to install for me, but YMMV. Nicely, they have added Arabic as a covered script in the most recent version. Out of curiosity, is it handwriting or typeset?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have experience, positive or otherwise, with Arabic OCR? How did you go about it, what did you use and did it require special configuration.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I run a lot of different Omeka instances and have to do all kinds of crazy deployments and maintenance. I packaged these all up in to a library that you can install (depends on Ruby) called &#60;a href=&#34;https://rubygems.org/gems/omeka-recipes&#34;&#62;omeka-recipes&#60;/a&#62;. You can set up pretty complex server configurations (e.g. staging, production, development) and move databases around with the database tasks. It also has the ability to sync assets (images, etc.), as well as help manage deployments. It may be way overkill for your needs, but for me, it's what I use to manage all of my Omeka instances.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Basic usage:&#60;/p&#62;


&#60;div class=&#34;bb_syntax&#34;&#62;&#60;div class=&#34;code&#34;&#62;&#60;pre class=&#34;ruby&#34; style=&#34;font-family:monospace;&#34;&#62;cap db:mysql:dump
cap db:mysql:fetch_dump
cap omeka:sync_assets&#60;/pre&#62;&#60;/div&#62;&#60;/div&#62;



&#60;p&#62;The first command will log on to your sever and generate a backup file for you (reading the db.ini file). The second will download the file to your local machine and the third will download everything in your archive directory to your local computer.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Good advice above. I'll add, though, that if you can back up the archives directory from the Omeka installation itself, it will be very valuable if you ever need it (hopefully not!).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That's because the database dump stores the connection between files and items via its own generated filename -- not what you have in the identifier field. That is, without having the files as Omeka recognizes them in the archives directory, you would risk losing the connection between item, metadata, and file, and would still end up having to recreate the connections. Trust me, this has the potential to make you cry!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, if you use the script Lincoln linked to, modifying it to make sure you grab a copy of the archives directory as well (or the whole kit and kaboodle of your installation) will be very helpful.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Good luck
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The script Lincoln linked to looks very good.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;mysqldump is exactly the command you want for this kind of backup.  It will create a file that contains everything you need to completely restore a MySQL database (the database schema and all your data).  For future reference, it is also possible to have mysqldump return just the data or just the schema.  On the command line type &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;mysqldump --help &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;to see all your options.  (If you've installed MySQL using MacPorts then the command is mysqldump5).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the help. The shell script strategy was the way I was going to go, as I had already figured out how to do mysqldump. Not knowing anything about MySQL, I wanted some confirmation that this backup file &#60;em&#62;really would&#60;/em&#62; contain everything I would need to restore the whole project. I'll also check out the script Lincoln recommends.

&#60;p&#62;Caleb,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You might take a look at &#60;a href=&#34;http://theme.fm/2011/06/a-shell-script-for-a-complete-wordpress-backup-4/&#34;&#62;this post that describes a shell script&#60;/a&#62; for automatically backing up WordPress. Since WordPress and Omeka run on the same stack, the script is probably pretty close to what you need.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I haven't spent much time in Omeka, but you could write a pretty simple shell script to manage this.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The first thing you should do is use mysqldump to output the database to a SQL export. Then either rsync of git push it to the local machine. After you get these mashed together into a script, add that to the /etc/crontab to schedule it.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That's an off the top of my head strategy, let me know if you want further detail and I'll try to make time to get you something to work with.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have no experience at all with PHP or MySQL, but I have recently put an Omeka installation on a server I have running on a virtual machine, where I have root privileges. If at all possible, I would like to be able to automatically back up my database to my local Unix-based machine at regular intervals, perhaps using something like Git or scp.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't necessarily have to backup all of the Omeka item files, as I have a folder on my local machine that contains all my PDFs and images in the Omeka database, with filenames that are identical to the &#34;Identifier&#34; field in my Omeka items. But I do want to get all of the metadata backed up, even just by grabbing the XML output. But I do want to be able to do this without having to think about it often or log in to Omeka to do the backup. Is there a way to do this?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear Rebecca,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Zotpress can display a collection with the following syntax: [zotpress collection=''   '']. You can see more in the help tab of your zotpress installation.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;BUT Zotpress' performances are rather bad and can slow down your whole website (mine is slow because of zotpress, but nobody reads it, so it does not really matter). So, maybe Mark Sample's instructions are still the best way to do what you want to do.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Best,&#60;br /&#62;
Frédéric

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Some of making this kind of thing work would probably involve installing new WordPress plugins and/or altering the PHP on the page. Searching in the WordPress forums might help - here's something that might be relevant: &#60;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/import-and-display-rss-feeds-on-front-page&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/import-and-display-rss-feeds-on-front-page&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Alas, I don't know of any newer solutions that have been built. But, I do know that relatively recently there has been a lot of work on the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/server_api/read_api&#34;&#62;Zotero API&#60;/a&#62;, and Faolan Cheslack-Postava built a &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/server_api#api_implementations&#34;&#62;PHP library&#60;/a&#62;, so if any developers or hackers want to tackle this, you'll have much better tools at your disposal.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Sorry to re-open this old can of worms, but I'm currently trying to embed a Zotero bibliography into a WordPress page, and all of the solutions I come across are from 2009-2010 (mostly responding to Mark Sample's epic post). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm wondering if anybody on this thread might have come across some other, better solution between then and now. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've tried Zotpress, but unless I'm much mistaken, the bibliographies that result will be static (won't update themselves based on new items added to Zotero as time goes on). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Is there anything out there that would combine the pretty metadata you get when you use Zotpress, with automatic updating? Is the Yahoo Pipes solution still the only way for this to work? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And, finally, is there anything out there that can also paginate a bibliography - display items in ten-item pages, say, rather than dumping everything into one monstrously long page or restricting the list to ten items? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;None of this may exist! But thank you in advance for your input. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Rebecca
