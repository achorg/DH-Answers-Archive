			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have experience, positive or otherwise, with Arabic OCR? How did you go about it, what did you use and did it require special configuration.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have no experience at all with PHP or MySQL, but I have recently put an Omeka installation on a server I have running on a virtual machine, where I have root privileges. If at all possible, I would like to be able to automatically back up my database to my local Unix-based machine at regular intervals, perhaps using something like Git or scp.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't necessarily have to backup all of the Omeka item files, as I have a folder on my local machine that contains all my PDFs and images in the Omeka database, with filenames that are identical to the &#34;Identifier&#34; field in my Omeka items. But I do want to get all of the metadata backed up, even just by grabbing the XML output. But I do want to be able to do this without having to think about it often or log in to Omeka to do the backup. Is there a way to do this?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Lately, I've noticed that questions have been very general and grandiose, so I thought I would take it back to the mundane a bit by trying out a technical question. The question itself is a bit of an experiment also, since I imagine it belongs more on the Zotero forum. I'm wonder what kind of productive overlap we can have between the two forums. The question came about after I saw &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mwidner&#34;&#62;@&#60;a href='/profile/mwidner'&#62;mwidner&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/a&#62; posted a link to &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelwidner.com/courses/e314lspring2011&#34;&#62;a new course&#60;/a&#62; where he will be using a zotero feed of his student's collaborative bibliography. I figure I could write to him, or play with the RSS until I figure it out, but then I thought an answer here would be more useful to the larger community. I will be happy to answer my self if I figure it out tonight, but if you have a ready answer feel free.

				<title>inactinique on "DOMDocument and UTF-8"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/domdocument-and-utf-8#post-1385</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm trying to use an under development plug-in for wordpress that is developped by @&#60;a href='/profile/clioweb'&#62;clioweb&#60;/a&#62; and @stakats from the CHNM. The aim of this plug-in is to take the content of a zotero user's CV and to publish it on your wordpress blog. Sean Takats is using it on his blog: &#60;a href=&#34;http://quintessenceofham.org/cv/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://quintessenceofham.org/cv/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My problem is the following: I'm French, so I've got accent in my name. See here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/inactinique/cv&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.zotero.org/inactinique/cv&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;When I'm using this plug-in, the accents in my name (and in all titles of my zotero CV page also - temporarily, I just found expressions in French with no accents for those titles) are not properly encoded on my website: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.clavert.net/wordpress/?page_id=333&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.clavert.net/wordpress/?page_id=333&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you look at the HTML code of the zotero CV page, the page is declared as UTF-8 encoded (just as my website). Accents in titles, in this code, are directly typed-in (é, è, etc), but in the rest of the source code, accents are encoded in HTML (&#38;eacute; &#38;egrave; etc).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So I suppose that the problem is the way DOMDocument and loadHTML in the php code of the plug-in are handling special caracters.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The source code of the plug-in is here: &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/inactinique/scholarpress-vitaware&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://github.com/inactinique/scholarpress-vitaware&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does someone have an idea? Please, be quite explicit in your answers - I'm starting with php.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Best regards,&#60;br /&#62;

				<title>Karin Dalziel on "Alternatives to Cocoon?"</title>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have used Cocoon to publish  TEI encoded XML files processed with XSLT (using Saxon), but I have never tried any other method of processing/publishing files. What alternatives are there? For many sites we generally use only a very small subsets of the features in cocoon - some basic redirecting and post processing.

				<title>Vika Zafrin on "What&#039;s wrong with python?"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/whats-wrong-with-python#post-117</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A collaborator I worked with a few years ago was in love with python.  According to him, python's strictly regimented syntax and its indentation requirements essentially forced good coding practices on people while providing a powerful engine for Doing Things.  To my collaborator, using it was as freeing as some people consider constrained writing to be.  Plus, I hear it's sometimes used to take advantage of the Java environment without having to learn Java.  So it's been in the back of my mind as a language I'd like to learn when an appropriate project presents itself.  (I'm terrible at learning programming by doing exercises.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Then yesterday, on Twitter, one of my DH friends said &#34;friends don't let friends program python.&#34;  What's that about?  Is it a matter of personal preference, or are there functions that we often need in DH but that python is unable to provide?  Or is there something else I need to know about it, a lurking dark secret?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And related, I guess: what programming language have you found to be the most versatile, in your DH work?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
