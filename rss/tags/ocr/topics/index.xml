			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm trying to create a corpus of texts to use for various data mining ends but can only access the texts in pdf form. I have 21  pdfs that range from 250-600 pages, most are within the 400-500 page range. I've tried online converters and they are not able to handle the process. Does anyone have a way of doing this?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm compiling a database of early modern texts in Spanish that have been converted to OCR. Specifically, I'm interested in texts that relate to or focus on early modern cities.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The main portals and host sites for texts, such as Cervantes Virtual (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cervantesvirtual.com)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.cervantesvirtual.com)&#60;/a&#62;, and the Spanish National Library (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/bib/portal/bne/obras.shtml/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/bib/portal/bne/obras.shtml/&#60;/a&#62;) are very good, but there is a lot of overlap in terms of content. Most texts belong to the core canons studied by Hispanic literature students in university, and the few sites that host historical documents and non-literary texts, such as the Patrimonio Bibliográfico Español (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mcu.es/bibliotecas/MC/CCPB/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mcu.es/bibliotecas/MC/CCPB/&#60;/a&#62;) have scanned images of the texts, but don't allow for character recognition.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Furthermore, these sources index their content by &#34;Author&#34; and/or &#34;Title,&#34; which means one usually needs to know what to look for in order to find anything.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Would anybody know of any portals or sites that host a wider variety of texts, and/or that allow for searches by year of publication?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks in advance for any help and recommendations.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have experience, positive or otherwise, with Arabic OCR? How did you go about it, what did you use and did it require special configuration.

				<title>cforster on "How to Handle Soft Hyphens in OCR&#039;d PDF?"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-to-handle-soft-hyphens-in-ocrd-pdf#post-180</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am using ABBYY Finereader 10.0 to OCR some material I've scanned. I would like to export the result as a PDF with the text &#34;under&#34; the image. Everything seems to be going well, &#60;em&#62;except&#60;/em&#62; the way that soft-hyphens (Finereader calls them &#34;optional hyphens&#34;) are handled in the PDF output. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While the OCR successfully recognizes most end-of-line hyphens as soft hyphens, when the result is exported to PDF, the word remains split in half and therefore will not appear in search results. For example, if the word &#34;digital&#34; appeared at the end of a line, hyphenated as &#34;digi-tal,&#34; Finereader recognizes the hyphen as a soft hyphen. But if I export to PDF and search for the term &#34;digital&#34; it will not be found (but &#34;digi-&#34; and &#34;tal&#34; would).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any thoughts on how to handle this? I could just manually rejoin these words, but that seems absurd. After futzing about for quite awhile, though, I've been unable to find a better solution.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does anyone know anything about software that can read (and play) sheet music if it is in a pdf or image format and create an .mp3 file? I googled some to locate a few things and it's hard to tell what the quality is like.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Has anybody -- particularly in project management or administrative roles in DH -- reached the mystical and possibly mythical state of the paperless office?  Can you recommend software and tools?  Tips or pitfalls?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm looking at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/index.html&#34;&#62;DEVONthink Pro Office&#60;/a&#62; which you can bundle with a bitty scanner for OCR.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I already make pretty good use of &#60;a href=&#34;http://evernote.com&#34;&#62;Evernote&#60;/a&#62; -- desktop, iPhone, and iPad versions.

				<title>Shane Landrum on "How to train OCRopus (or other open-source OCR software)?"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-to-train-ocropus-or-other-open-source-ocr-software#post-329</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have a batch of JPEG images of typescript correspondence from the early 20th century which should be plenty high-quality to run through OCR. All I'm looking for is a good way to get a mostly-trustworthy set of searchable text out of a mass of images. I don't really have the budget to invest in commercial OCR software, and I know there's gotta be an open-source way to do what I want.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far, the best option I've found for open-source OCR software is &#60;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/ocropus/&#34;&#62;OCRopus&#60;/a&#62;, which is under heavy development. I've been able to get it to generate basic output in the &#60;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/hocr-tools/&#34;&#62;hOCR HTML format&#60;/a&#62;, but there's no good documentation on how to train it for better recognition of a particular corpus of images. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm imagining that I should be able to take the output from an ocropus run over a particular image (A.xml), copy it to B.xml, correct the mis-recognitions in B.xml, and run some command on the resulting files to train ocropus for better recognition. However, the documentation as it exists is designed more for developers than for users, and I'm having trouble deciphering the proper way to do what I want.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Has anyone successfully done this, and if so, how? Is there some other package that's easier or better to use for this purpose?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks in advance for your thoughts.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I work in contemporary literature, so almost everything I study is under copyright. Many things I study are available in attenuated digital formats like google books, or kindle editions, but those sorts of formats are not available for doing even a simple text manipulation or visualization, like, say slamming it into Wordle. Other that pushing for available full-access digital editions, what tools are there out there for those times when you find yourself confronted with something that is irredeemably paper?
