			<description>&#60;p&#62;pdf2txt really does give you plain text.  PrimeOCR has settings for the output: among other possible formats are RTF and plain text.  I would imagine that other OCR packages can also create plain text if properly configured.  If not, I would think you could post-process the output with another tool (such as rtf2txt).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does anyone know if theses solutions convert the PDFs to completely plain text, so no formatting at all, or, if there are others out there?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We have a prof who is working with PDFs from the Congressional Record, and he needs absolutely clean, non-formatted plain text to then use in a programming software. So far he's doing this by hand because any OCR tools still leave some formatting.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If it's already in digital text form, pdf2txt is great.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If it's just images (the easiest way to check is if you can copy and paste from the file in Acrobat or Preview or whatever), you have to do the OCR as well: if you have a Mac, I wrote up &#60;a href=&#34;http://benschmidt.org/dighist13/?page_id=129&#34;&#62;one blow-by-blow for a free solution on the command line&#60;/a&#62; for my grad class a while ago. There are software packages your library might have, as well, that would make it easier.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you know a friendly neighborhood Linux user, there's a package called pdf2txt that would likely be able to do it. I don't know if similar is available on other operating systems

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm trying to create a corpus of texts to use for various data mining ends but can only access the texts in pdf form. I have 21  pdfs that range from 250-600 pages, most are within the 400-500 page range. I've tried online converters and they are not able to handle the process. Does anyone have a way of doing this?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Europeana allows searches by year and city... it can be a helpful resource although it contains only images... Maybe your database would be a nice DH project :)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are some linguistic corpus that give you back some results if you search specific names of cities. Have a look at the CORDE: &#60;a href=&#34;http://corpus.rae.es/cordenet.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://corpus.rae.es/cordenet.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We are collecting bibliography about hispanic projects here: &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/groups/humanidades_digitales&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.zotero.org/groups/humanidades_digitales&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You can explore yourself the group library but it is focused on literary studies yet not limited to. So if you found anything interesting during your research please share with us. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;All the best

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm compiling a database of early modern texts in Spanish that have been converted to OCR. Specifically, I'm interested in texts that relate to or focus on early modern cities.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The main portals and host sites for texts, such as Cervantes Virtual (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cervantesvirtual.com)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.cervantesvirtual.com)&#60;/a&#62;, and the Spanish National Library (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/bib/portal/bne/obras.shtml/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/bib/portal/bne/obras.shtml/&#60;/a&#62;) are very good, but there is a lot of overlap in terms of content. Most texts belong to the core canons studied by Hispanic literature students in university, and the few sites that host historical documents and non-literary texts, such as the Patrimonio Bibliográfico Español (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mcu.es/bibliotecas/MC/CCPB/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mcu.es/bibliotecas/MC/CCPB/&#60;/a&#62;) have scanned images of the texts, but don't allow for character recognition.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Furthermore, these sources index their content by &#34;Author&#34; and/or &#34;Title,&#34; which means one usually needs to know what to look for in order to find anything.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Would anybody know of any portals or sites that host a wider variety of texts, and/or that allow for searches by year of publication?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks in advance for any help and recommendations.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In unrelated research, I found a tesseract training GUI written by a web developer: &#60;a href=&#34;http://pp19dd.com/2010/09/tesseract-ocr-boxfile-ajax-editor/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://pp19dd.com/2010/09/tesseract-ocr-boxfile-ajax-editor/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
Since I haven't had to train tesseract yet, I'm not entirely confident of reading that page well, but it looks like it might be useful if you find the existing tesseract Arabic data lacking.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It was originally written in 2010, but has been updated for tesseract v3.

&#60;p&#62;typeset very consistently in the late '50s, but the letters look a little &#34;fancy&#34; and have a lot of very thin lines. I don't read Arabic, so can't describe in more detail.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I haven't used it for this case, but I had some minor POC success with &#60;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/&#34;&#62;Tesseract&#60;/a&#62;. It was non-trivial to install for me, but YMMV. Nicely, they have added Arabic as a covered script in the most recent version. Out of curiosity, is it handwriting or typeset?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have experience, positive or otherwise, with Arabic OCR? How did you go about it, what did you use and did it require special configuration.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There's a solution if you first import it into Word before turning it into a PDF.  First, highlight the soft hyphen and copy it.  Then, Control H (search and replace).  Paste the hyphen in the &#34;Find What&#34; box.  Replace it with a regular hyphen or some other sequence of characters, such as ***.  Then do a search and replace for the regular hyphen or the *** and replace it with nothing!  Et voila.  For some odd reason searching in Word for the ABBYYFine generated hyphen and replacing it with nothing doesn't work.&#60;/p&#62;

				<title>Michael Good on "What is the best Music Scanning Software?"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/what-is-the-best-music-scanning-software#post-1192</link>
			<pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2011 22:44:48 +0000</pubDate>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The four main commercial music scanning products are:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62; - SmartScore&#60;br /&#62;
 - PhotoScore&#60;br /&#62;
 - capella-scan&#60;br /&#62;
 - SharpEye Music Reader&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The first two run on Windows and Mac, the second two run on Windows only.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Which one is best is really an &#34;it depends&#34; type of answer. It depends on the repertoire you are scanning and your work style preferences. All of these programs have demos, so the best approach is to download the demos and see how well they work with your music. All the programs should work fine of relatively simple music, and have more trouble as the music gets more complex - particularly with counterpoint on a single staff, as in keyboard music.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You will probably find it easiest to use the scanner to do the scanning, and then edit things further for an MP3 in another program. All four products export MusicXML files so you can easily use the results with other programs. PhotoScore has special export to Sibelius and capella-scan has special export to capella, in addition to the MusicXML export.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;No current program works with handwritten music. You need to be working with printed music. PhotoScore has a limited handwritten capability but that requires you writing the music in a particular PhotoScore-friendly style.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If your PDF is actually produced by a music notation program, you can get better results with PDFtoMusic Pro. It can take advantage of knowing that you have music fonts, lines, and other higher-level graphics rather than just having dots on a page from a scanner. If you have an optical scan, though, PDFtoMusic Pro can't work with it at all, so it's a more specialized tool.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I hope this helps!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The level of accuracy of any commercial OMR software is very poor for anything but the most simple and standard music notation. The current &#34;state of the art&#34; software is PhotoScore (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.neuratron.com/photoscore.htm)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.neuratron.com/photoscore.htm)&#60;/a&#62;. You can download and try a demo.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Donald Byrd has produced a paper comparing the output of many of the commercial applications. You can read it here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/MROMR2009Pap/OMREvaluation+Prospects4MROMR.doc&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/MROMR2009Pap/OMREvaluation+Prospects4MROMR.doc&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Good luck!
