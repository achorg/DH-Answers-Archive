			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Miriam,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've been sketching out how I work here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://j.mp/digital-smg&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://j.mp/digital-smg&#60;/a&#62;  But for actual step-by-step workflow, take a look at Bill Turkel: &#60;a href=&#34;http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am asking this question on behalf of Media Studies professor Hector Amaya. He is working on a project revolving around the Narco-violence phenomenon on the US-Mexico border. As part of his project he wants to archive a series of blogs that have sprouted on the blogosphere reacting to the violence. The blogs are a sort of citizens media that functions in lieu of an effectively intimidated official media. The blogs (and the bloggers) are of course very vulnerable. Here are two of the key blogs:  El Blog del Narco: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.blogdelnarco.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.blogdelnarco.com/&#60;/a&#62; and El Mundo del Narco: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mundonarco.com/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.mundonarco.com/&#60;/a&#62;. There are many other he wants to archive, but other than the InternetArchive, I don't know anyone who has done this. An HTML capture will probably work, but I don't even know how one would do that with a series of blogs. Any ideas?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Folks,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm considering a project that is more or less on my own time, and sort of in an area of inquiry that I don't often pursue. Therefore, I hope to get some input on the right toolset to get some work done.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My great grandfather was a newspaper columnist, and his work is currently only available in microfilm and in moldy boxes at my grandmother's house. I would love to get this electronified, even if it's only for our family to use.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Omeka seems like the logical choice for organizing and eventually conveying the archive, but what else can I use to 1) make this as painless as possible and 2) give me a rich set of data for interesting analysis and text mining?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The stack of papers is pretty large -- we're looking at 35 years-worth of daily columns. The kinds of things I'd be interested in tracking would mostly be time-based (i.e. keyed to periods of time like presidencies or other historical events. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I do have some help, in siblings and cousins, for transcriptions or other tedious work, but is there some OCR approach I should consider?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This is very much in the &#34;Maybe we could do this ...&#34; phase, so I'd appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks,&#60;br /&#62;
Zach

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've often found myself wondering if anybody has written a book-length narrative history telling the story of humanities computing/digital humanities from the early days of humanities computing until now (or some approximation thereof), addressing major milestone DH projects, related efforts, and some of the big themes of the field as they've evolved--or haven't--over time?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I suspect that some histories may have been done that address particular disciplines (e.g. digital history), but have they been tied together and examined as a whole?  I see that the question has been addressed in conference presentations, such as those by &#60;a href=&#34;http://infomotions.com/blog/tag/digital-humanities/&#34;&#62;Joe Raben&#60;/a&#62; or &#60;a href=&#34;http://infomotions.com/blog/2010/05/cyberinfrastructure-days-at-the-university-of-notre-dame/&#34;&#62;St√©fan Sinclair&#60;/a&#62;, and appears in Chapter 1 of Schreibman et al.'s &#34;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/&#34;&#62;A Companion to Digital Humanities&#60;/a&#62;,&#34; but I wondered if anything longer has been published.  I may well have just sailed right past it.  Seems like it would make a great oral history project, too.
