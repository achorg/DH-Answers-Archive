			<description>&#60;p&#62;This fall, I'm teaching a course called &#34;Literature of Information Overload.&#34; It's a 200-level undergraduate course in English. Students will mostly be sophomore English majors, I'd imagine.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I need help with selecting texts for this course! Below is a draft of the course description and a list of texts I've started (obviously I won't include all this on the syllabus, but I just wanted to give a sense of what I'm thinking). I'm looking for fiction, non-fiction, films -- you name it. Even if I don't use something in the syllabus, I'd like to compile a longer list of &#34;recommended reading and resources&#34; to post on the course website. &#60;strong&#62;I'm open to all ideas/suggestions.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;br /&#62;

&#60;em&#62;Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense. They listen so much that they forget to be natural. This is a nice story.&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/stein-atom-bomb.html&#34;&#62;Gertrude Stein, 1946&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Information overload is a contemporary cultural concern with a rich past. This course will cover a broad sampling of texts from different time periods to consider how our current confrontation/struggle with digital technologies both &#60;em&#62;is&#60;/em&#62; and &#60;em&#62;is not&#60;/em&#62; new. We will pay attention to the various forms that information overload takes: a pathological condition, a burden on attention and social bonds, a renaissance of knowledge access and production, and even a non-issue. Most importantly for our purposes, the texts we read and view will help us to ask how our understanding of knowledge, literature, and even ourselves evolves alongside technological innovations.  Through studying texts that comment on, represent, and/or actually produce the feeling of overload in readers, we will encounter questions like:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;How do people experience and describe information overload (or a sense of &#34;too much&#34;) across cultures and chapters of technological development? In what ways is the contemporary predicament of information management similar to and different from struggles of the past?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;How does information overload contribute to distraction and changing modes of attention, and why is this relevant to today's readers of literature? &#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;What are the differences between information and literature? What is at stake in efforts to make a distinction?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;If we accept the story of how humans are becoming increasingly dependent on their reference tools and technological devices, what new types of machine-human hybrids emerge? What reasons might we find for accepting or resisting this cyborg vision?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Through engaging with these questions and the texts (some alphabetic and others visual) on the syllabus, we will learn how information overload functions as a subject matter, a form or structuring device, and an affect generated by the work itself. This final affective quality of information overload (the feeling of having &#60;em&#62;too much&#60;/em&#62; to know and organize) is a familiar frenemy of college students, so I hope that you will draw on your personal experiences to enlighten our discussions and inform your writing.&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There are now a number of universities offering courses in digital history. When you look at individual syllabi, however, there is quite a variety in approaches or topics covered. If you were given the task of designing a curriculum or a series of courses to be taught alongside more traditional history courses, what would you include? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Let's say it's a series of 4 courses, one per semester over 2 years, that begins with first year students (undergraduate freshmen) with a goal of producing digitally &#34;nimble&#34; history students or even digital historians (feel free to define both of those!). How would you balance theory, general information literacy skills, projects, programming, etc? What would be the &#34;must include&#34; pieces and which would be the ideal? What mix of lecture-based, active learning/project based, discussion/seminar, online/face-to-face/hybrid or other configuration would you build?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This spring I'm teaching a survey of literary criticism. We need to cover many of the major movements during the semester, and I will only have 1 week to devote to DH. I do, however, want my students to be aware of this increasingly influential field--and, of course, the field I'm most interested in myself.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What 2-3 articles would you include in such a survey? They'd need to be fairly broad--for students who aren't necessarily interested in DH (at least not yet). Stephen Ramsay's &#34;Algorithmic Criticism&#34; (&#60;a href=&#34;http://tiny.cc/d81s6&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://tiny.cc/d81s6&#60;/a&#62;) was suggested on Twitter. Other ideas?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
