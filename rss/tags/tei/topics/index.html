			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear community,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am intensively testing exports to PDF from TEI documents and can’t figure where could be the problem. The document is always fully valid, CSS rendition (default) work properly. However, in the result there is always missing the label, which is always coded as table’s head.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;code&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
  &#38;lt;table rendition=&#34;simple:frame&#34;&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
    &#38;lt;head&#38;gt;The head!&#38;lt;/head&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;/code&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have noticed it is really important to test several types of notation when testing outputs via XSLT (e.g. footnotes’ rendition is rather an adventure!) but here I tried almost everything and nothing helps. It seems the &#60;code&#62;tei:head&#60;/code&#62; part from XSL templates is not passed into the final output. In XeLaTeX it worked well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Is there something I am omitting in the code and what Oxygen needs for proper rendition? (like rend=&#34;header&#34; or so?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any help more than welcome!&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I’ve been using CATMA (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.catma.de/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.catma.de/&#60;/a&#62;) to markup a text with some analytical tags I’ve created. I then exported the file in TEI, and I’m now trying to extract the data I’ve marked up in order to measure tag frequencies, but am finding it quite difficult. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Rather than tagging text with the labels I’ve created, CATMA has established a somewhat complicated (though likely necessary) system of identifiers. So, for example, I’ve tagged the word “clouds” in my text with the tag “weather,” which is a child of the tagset “non-living.” &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;CATMA represents the tag in the text like this:&#60;br /&#62;
&#38;lt;text&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
     &#38;lt;body&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
          &#38;lt;ab type=“catma”&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
Small feckless &#38;lt;seg ana=&#34;#CATMA_0036983F-4D37-48C2-8BC7-5846A8364D26&#34;&#38;gt;clouds&#38;lt;/seg&#38;gt; were hurried across the vast untroubled sky...&#60;br /&#62;
          &#38;lt;/ab&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
     &#38;lt;/body&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
&#38;lt;/text&#38;gt;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The identifier then points to this feature statement after the body of the text:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#38;lt;text&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
     &#38;lt;body&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
     &#38;lt;/body&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
          &#38;lt;fs xml:id=&#34;CATMA_0036983F-4D37-48C2-8BC7-5846A8364D26&#34; type=&#34;CATMA_3CDE1FE4-CA5D-4460-9BFF-739537D753DE&#34;&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
            &#38;lt;f name=&#34;catma_displaycolor&#34;&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
                &#38;lt;string&#38;gt;-16710765&#38;lt;/string&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
            &#38;lt;/f&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
            &#38;lt;f name=&#34;catma_markupauthor&#34;&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
                &#38;lt;string&#38;gt;name@email&#38;lt;/string&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
            &#38;lt;/f&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
        &#38;lt;/fs&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
&#38;lt;/text&#38;gt;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The id for the type of the fs then points back up to the feature statement declaration in the header:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#38;lt;teiHeader&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
     &#38;lt;encodingDesc&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;

                            &#38;lt;/vColl&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
                        &#38;lt;/vRange&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
                    &#38;lt;/fDecl&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;

     &#38;lt;/encodingDesc&#38;gt;&#60;br /&#62;
&#38;lt;/teiHeader&#38;gt; &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I need to extract the text and data, perhaps in a csv file (or other output format, if it’s easier), into something that lists the tagged text (e.g. “clouds”) in one column, the first tag applied to it in the next column (e.g. &#34;weather&#34;), and the tagset or category to which that tag belongs in the next (e.g. &#34;non-living). &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Or perhaps there’s a better way—really, what I’d like to be able to do is get the frequencies of each tag &#38;amp; tagset for each chapter. If there’s an easier way to mark up the text in TEI that would better allow for what I need, I’m open to re-encoding manually.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I’ve also tried playing around a bit with some XSLT and a Python script (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.rdegges.com/quickly-extract-xml-data-with-python/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.rdegges.com/quickly-extract-xml-data-with-python/&#60;/a&#62;) but with very little experience with either, I find myself quickly out of my depths. Open to suggestions—and thanks in advance for your help!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd like to use the available corpora in the German Text Archive (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/download&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/download&#60;/a&#62;) to train OCR software. For this I need these texts as plaintext. All the German Text Archive texts however are all TEI P5 tagged. How do I best convert these (hundreds..) of documents into plaintext? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm comfortable on the command line and with small shell scripts but I wouldn't be able to write an app to make use of a public API to such a service. Ideally I'd like to find some tei2text-ish command line tool but the ones I've found in googling around and looking on GitHub don't appear (to me, leastways) to be suitable for TEI texts.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I was wondering if someone might be able to help me out with a query. I'm looking to put online a parallel text consisting of a published work, and draft manuscripts on which the work was based. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've envisaged presenting it with the published work on one side of the page, and transcripts of the manuscripts opposite (I'd also like to be able to link to digital images of the manuscripts). Both the work and the transcripts would be encoded in TEI.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone know of available tools which might be useful in this instance? I've been having a look around, and most of my searches return tools for linguistics, which aren't really helpful as far as I can tell.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I distinctly remember being shown such a tool for parallel texts about eighteen months ago, but like an idiot, have forgotten its name and can't find it anywhere.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any help would be very much appreciated!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;best wishes,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Tim

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am beginning to work on a project digitizing a series of notebooks, and each page in the notebook will contain annotations created by the project archivist.  I am going to be using Annotorious (&#60;a href=&#34;http://annotorious.github.io/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://annotorious.github.io/&#60;/a&#62;) for the annotation engine, following the model of using OpenLayers to annotate zoomable images.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Much to my surprise, TEI can handle the storage of annotations natively within the schema with facsimile and surface elements.  Some use cases are well-documented at &#60;a href=&#34;http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Talks/2009-07-dublin/talk7_facsimile.xml&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Talks/2009-07-dublin/talk7_facsimile.xml&#60;/a&#62;.  However, the attributes designated for storing x and y coordinates of the annotations only accept literal pixel coordinates, i. e., they must be positive integers.  For annotations made in OpenLayers, for example, the x and y coordinates are represented relatively within the bounds of the image, which are dynamically calculated based on the height and width of the source image file.  Therefore, the surface element may appear as follows:&#60;/p&#62;


&#60;div class=&#34;bb_syntax&#34;&#62;&#60;table&#62;&#60;tr&#62;&#60;td class=&#34;line_numbers&#34;&#62;&#60;pre&#62;1
&#60;/pre&#62;&#60;/td&#62;&#60;td class=&#34;code&#34;&#62;&#60;pre class=&#34;xml&#34; style=&#34;font-family:monospace;&#34;&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color: #009900;&#34;&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&#34;&#62;&#38;lt;surface&#60;/span&#62; &#60;span style=&#34;color: #000066;&#34;&#62;ulx&#60;/span&#62;=&#60;span style=&#34;color: #ff0000;&#34;&#62;&#38;quot;-0.86269991934014&#38;quot;&#60;/span&#62; &#60;span style=&#34;color: #000066;&#34;&#62;uly&#60;/span&#62;=&#60;span style=&#34;color: #ff0000;&#34;&#62;&#38;quot;0.34903242955874003&#38;quot;&#60;/span&#62; &#60;span style=&#34;color: #000066;&#34;&#62;lrx&#60;/span&#62;=&#60;span style=&#34;color: #ff0000;&#34;&#62;&#38;quot;-0.053827751&#38;quot;&#60;/span&#62; &#60;span style=&#34;color: #000066;&#34;&#62;lry&#60;/span&#62;=&#60;span style=&#34;color: #ff0000;&#34;&#62;&#38;quot;-0.216358041&#38;quot;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&#34;&#62;/&#38;gt;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/pre&#62;&#60;/td&#62;&#60;/tr&#62;&#60;/table&#62;&#60;/div&#62;



&#60;p&#62;The values of these attributes are invalid according to the schema.  Ideally, I would like to use an official schema.  Are there other semantically acceptable ways to encode these coordinates?  Or should I edit the schema and validate on a local, modified copy?  Furthermore, should I send an email out to a TEI list with this use case?  It seems plausible that other projects may want to annotate images in this way, and perhaps the attributes should be relaxed to accept decimal numbers rather than integers.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have a beginners question re TEI 5 and would be grateful for any suggestions re same.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;How does one begin to encode metdata? ie: I have a transcription and am doing a very light encoding thereof - just &#38;lt;head&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/head&#38;gt;, &#38;lt;person&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/person&#38;gt;, &#38;lt;place&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/place&#38;gt; (which hopefully are correct!). If I have footnotes re certain parts of the main body of text, how to encode it and where to I place it in the TEI that I am writing in Oxygen Editor (ie: How do I show what the info refers to? Do I keep the footnote system?)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks.

						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/semantic-tagging-in-tei#post-1886</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Friendly DHers:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The Dynamic Table of Contexts team is developing a semantic tagset that will be used to encode a collection of scholarly essays.&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
We are currently trying to incorporate this tagset, which is largely based off of Orlando’s tagset, into a TEI-based schema. We intend to tag sections of the text (whole paragraphs, single words, etc.) that corresponds to index-like concepts, such as ‘history’ or ‘politics’.&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
To tag these concepts, we have employed TEI’s ‘term’ element. The various semantic categories feature as values of the ‘term’ element, e.g. &#38;lt;term type=”politics”&#38;gt;.&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
The problem with using the ‘term’ tag in this way is that it is unable to handle nested quote tags or paragraph tags. That is, TEI does not allow &#38;lt;q&#38;gt; tags inside a ‘term’ tag, nor does it allow the ‘term’ tag to wrap around a &#38;lt;p&#38;gt; tag. This restricts the ‘term’ tag’s usage. Ideally, we want to be able to identify concepts across paragraphs.&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
We have searched for an alternative to the ‘term’ tag in the TEI catalogue but apart from customizing the schema, we have not found an adequate solution. At this point in the project, we are interested in sticking to the TEI’s standards. Is there a term-like tag in TEI that we have overlooked?&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
We would appreciate some feedback on this issue of semantic tagging in TEI.&#60;br /&#62;
 &#60;br /&#62;
ALSO, we are interested in tagging instances of genre in the collection, but again, TEI does not provide a ‘genre’ tag. Is there a clear solution here that we have missed?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dear colleagues,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;as staff member of the Deutsches Textarchiv (www.deutschestextarchiv.de), I would be interested in studies on the accuracy of double keying, esp. in large full text, tei/xml annotated corpora. Service providers advertise accuracy rates of 99.+%, has anyone ever questioned this on an empirical basis? I have found various musings on OCR accuracy and on how to improve results here, but nothing similar on double keying. I would be grateful for any hints.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks in advance,&#60;br /&#62;
all the best&#60;br /&#62;
Christian Thomas &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(I also mailed this to Humanist, as here and there will not be exactly the same people reading, I hope. If so, please apologize cross-posting...)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm working with a partner on an update to the TEIDisplay plugin for Omeka and looking for user input. Do you use TEIDisplay or another tool for displaying TEI Documents? Why did you choose that tool and how does it meet/not meet your needs? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Additionally, what type of documents would you expect to display (e.g., poetry, correspondence, etc.) in a generalizable interface? For a general audience, what should a template for displaying these texts in an Omeka exhibit include? For instance, which teiHeader elements are most important (e.g., file description, revision history)? Would you want to display bibliographic codes and numbers such as page breaks and numbers or paragraph numbers? We assume folks would want to see additions and deletions and notes, but what other aspects of your texts should be displayed for a general audience? What would you add to this list for a general audience?&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello,&#60;br /&#62;
I'm working on an ongoing research project at my school where I will be encoding in TEI.  I was just curious if anyone had a list of standard TEI tags, and specifically tags for SmallCaps, Hyphens, and M-lines.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We'd like to point to freely available, well formatted TEI texts online (poetry, prose). Where is the best URL to send people? TEI By Example doesn't have whole texts. Projects Using TEI (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/&#60;/a&#62;) is somewhat difficult to peruse, can have dead links, and doesn't indicate if the texts are available or not. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any suggestions?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Folks&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd like to know a little more about how the DH community is using TEI by Example (&#60;a href=&#34;http://tbe.kantl.be/TBE/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://tbe.kantl.be/TBE/)&#60;/a&#62;. Have you used it as an individual, or in a class, or in a workshop, or That Camp? Could you sum up in a sentence or two how, where, and when you have found it useful?&#60;br /&#62;
best&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For my dissertation, I'm keeping track of nineteenth-century converts. I'd like to keep the data about the converts in both a human- and computer readable format. The data model needs to grow organically, because I only have a reasonable guess right now what information might be interesting about converts. The amount of data on each convert will be vastly different, from the bare information that a person converted (I might not even know a name) to having volumes of the person's papers. Also, each person might convert multiple times. Some information I want to keep track of as data (e.g., converted from, converted to, converted date), and other information can be tossed into a notes field. Finally, I have to be able to read the data myself as notes for writing, and to access it programmatically from some unknown tool (probably Ruby). While these needs are specific to my purposes, I think they could be easily generalized. For example, someone might want to keep track of strikes for a labor history.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm thinking about using &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html&#34;&#62;YAML&#60;/a&#62; as the format for the data. YAML's two top priorities are &#34;YAML is easily readable by humans&#34; and &#34;YAML data is portable between programming languages,&#34; which match my own. It also seems to be dead-simple to markup data. I've created a sample file for modeling the life of Orestes Brownson, which is below.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My questions are these:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ol&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Is anyone using YAML for a digital humanities project? How are you using it, and what experience have you gained?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Can anyone offer specific comments on the data modeled below?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ol&#62;

  This is a minimal example of what a model of a convert might look
  like. The historical data is hastily gathered, so only the model is
  of interest here.

  N.B. I would like to replace the citations with BibTeX keys.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have specific examples of assignments that use TEI encoding to do a close reading of a text? The assignment, the results or general comments about how that could be structured, or if it did work with students, would be appreciated.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
