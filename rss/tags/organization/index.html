			<description>&#60;p&#62;The qualitative text analysis program, MAXQDA, allows you to code and annotate pdf, doc, txt, and rtf files--so it's possible later to search and retrieve across photos, website content, interview transcriptions, academic articles, etc.  There's also a new web-based software called Dedoose that works in a similar way--definitely a tool that could be used to organize digital humanities and multimedia social sciences projects.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'll mention two pieces of software and give you a link to blog posts I've found that explain their utility in this context:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Scrivener - a great research/writing tool for Mac (and now Windows).  Even compiles into Epub or Kindle (.mobi) if desired.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.organizingcreativity.com/2009/08/scrivener-a-perfect-program-for-dissertation-writing/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.organizingcreativity.com/2009/08/scrivener-a-perfect-program-for-dissertation-writing/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tameri.com/wordpress/2010/06/28/why-i-use-scrivener/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tameri.com/wordpress/2010/06/28/why-i-use-scrivener/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;DevonThink Pro - for storage/retrieval of research materials&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://idlethink.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/on-devonthink-and-history-research-i/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://idlethink.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/on-devonthink-and-history-research-i/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Someone mentioned this, sort of, but I've become a believer in Evernote as of late. I can save any type of media, and add comments right in the note, then using tags, organize my notes in folders. In addition to Evernote, and keeping with the simplicity theme, Dropbox is as easy as it gets for syncing and keeping things in order, in my opinion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for a name for the workshop:&#60;br /&#62;
Organization is half the Dissertation Battle - Mastering Digital Asset Management

&#60;p&#62;Agreed, manual item by item editing in Omeka is still a drag though it's possible to avoid some of this by keeping one's catalog/metadata in a database or Excel and periodically uploading this to Omeka as CSV.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If these students are interested not only in attaching metadata to digital objects but also annotating these digitally, I recommend qualitative analysis software like NVivo.  (There are surely other options, but this is the one I played around with about eight years ago.)  You can add annotations to various file formats and search across them.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for these excellent answers, y'all! I'm really intrigued by the idea of making your research process public with Omeka, and in a way, it makes a lot of sense, especially with Scripto integration for transcription. But it seems to me that the process of attaching metadata to each archival document individually could be unworkably time-consuming, depending on how much material you have. Plus, maybe it's just my server, but Omeka can be a bit slow to navigate sometimes. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Alex, personally, I do use Zotero to organize my sources, and it works great for me. Still, for some things, it's not totally ideal. For example, it doesn't show you a preview of photographs, so if you have a lot of them, it can be difficult to figure out which one you want. Also, while I would be really cool and organized if I attached metadata to each item, I often return from the archives with hundreds or even thousands of photographs. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One thing students have been asking me about is just managing file sizes, saving things in proper formats, developing naming conventions, and backing up their data. I'm thinking one place to point them is the Library of Congress's information on personal digital archiving. Without trying to turn these students into professional archivists, I'm very interested in hearing what other helpful information is out there.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Now you have me wondering if I'm the only one who uses &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/&#34;&#62;Zotero&#60;/a&#62; to keep track of and annotate all my digital assets. I really don't even use evernote or any kind of note-taker, the note-taking feature in Zotero being good enough. With Zotero you can also attach any file type to a bibliographic entry. In theory and practice, there shouldn't be anything in the dissertation that cannot be assigned to a bibliographic entry. While my system file structure is organized by subject headings that more or less resemble the LOC system, my Zotero is organized by projects, with a folder for unfiled items (always empty).  Each project has a folder for primary sources and one for secondary sources. That is really all I've ever needed.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I like Bill Turkel's workflow, especially the idea of digitizing all documents you will be working with. I work with manuscripts and typescripts often, so I also strive to not only create images of these, but to transcribe them as well. In real life this can only remain a goal to aspire too. If done early and consistently, though, you can get MOST of your materials in the computer, and this is a big +.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There are useful links in Shane Landrum's &#34;Digital Research Methods Roundup&#34; earlier this year: &#60;a href=&#34;http://cliotropic.org/blog/2011/03/digital-research-methods-roundup/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://cliotropic.org/blog/2011/03/digital-research-methods-roundup/&#60;/a&#62; , and an additional follow-up by Chad Black, &#60;a href=&#34;https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/update-on-the-ever-changing-workflow/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/update-on-the-ever-changing-workflow/&#60;/a&#62; . Tim Burke's post on note-taking and suggestions in comments might also give some ideas. &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/2011/07/21/technology-note-taking-and-research-workflow/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/2011/07/21/technology-note-taking-and-research-workflow/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;For graduate students who are gathering large, especially image based collections one useful strategy is to setup an Omeka archive. This has a couple of nice side-benefits: first, it'll get their material into a format that they can footnote/cite (Omeka creates the citation link) and along the way force them to tighten up their record-keeping a little. Two, it gives them a standard way to relate items to each other (either via the DC Relation field, or if they're meticulous, via FRBR) in an organized and consistent manner. Third, all metadata is searchable by field and as full-text. This already covers much of what they would want from a locally stored and cataloged collection. Granted this will require a greater degree of organization and discipline up front but it'll pay off dividends later on by attracting others interested in the topic and by generating some early recognition for their expertise. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For a very nice example of this type of set-up, see Radu Suciu's online archive &#60;a href=&#34;http://melancholystories.com&#34;&#62;Medical Case Studies on Renaissance Melancholy&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://radusuciu.posterous.com/&#34;&#62;associated dissertation research blog&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Here at Emory, we're planning a workshop to introduce grad students to some digital tricks for managing their research assets (especially primary sources). We know that no one tool or technique will work for everyone, but we'd like to introduce our grad students to a few new ideas.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's the situation we're trying to address: A grad student in the dissertation-writing stage has gathered folders and folders of digital photos, PDF newspaper articles, research notes, maybe video clips and sound files. How does she organize this mess and make individual documents easily retrievable when she actually needs to write about them?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd love to know what software you use, how you use it, and any other tricks you can share. For my purposes, simpler is better, since we'll be introducing these techniques to non-programmers.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And we need a name for the workshop! Any ideas?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
