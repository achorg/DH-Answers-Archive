			<description>&#60;p&#62;You mean another wizard-like interface for interactively choosing the appropriate license?  How about &#60;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/choose/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://creativecommons.org/choose/&#60;/a&#62; ?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A colleague passed along this source for forms: &#60;a href=&#34;http://selector.harmonyagreements.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://selector.harmonyagreements.org/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Is anyone aware of a similar set of agreements for CC?

&#60;p&#62;Thanks this is what I was looking for. I am curious now about what they mention about forming an s-corporation, etc. I'll start a new question for that.

&#60;p&#62;While not designed for contributors to DH projects in particular, you might look at the agreements in &#34;section B&#34; of &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.publishing.umich.edu/Publishing_Agreements&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://wiki.publishing.umich.edu/Publishing_Agreements&#60;/a&#62; .  In these agreements, the author of a work grants rights to a party responsible for the journal or book series.  These rights include allowing their work to be published under a CC license.

&#60;p&#62;Thanks, that was also my understanding, but it is interesting that the TEI consortium is using both at the link above. Of course they are doing so for ODD files and other objects that are part code/part data.

&#60;p&#62;I'd like to bump my question: Would anyone want to share agreement form that they use for contributors? I am imagining a document in which a contributor could license or otherwise give the rights to the data they are contributing to a project (yes, they could also put the CC license directly into the data, but it would also be useful to have some sort of user agreement that users could sign acknowledging the use of the open licenses).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;CC licenses are general purpose content licenses, and shouldn't be used for software licensing (in fact, Creative Commons themselves are the ones that state as much: &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software)&#60;/a&#62;. Likewise, it wouldn't make sense to use a license designed for software for your non-code content. Given this, I've generally used a CC-BY license for the content and an MIT license for the code (though some recent projects I've been involved with have chosen to go with the Mozilla license for the code rather than MIT).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Any more answers on this question?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Specifically, I am curious about the following. If I were to follow the TEI consortium practice, can I license both content and code simultaneousely under CC-BY and BSD-2 or -3 Clause? (Can I license content that is just plain text under BSD-2 or 3?).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Secondly, I am curious could anyone share contributor forms that you ask contributors to sign authorizing these licenses?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The TEI Technical Council had a long discussion on licensing of the TEI Guidelines ODD files and software maintained by the TEI Consortium.  See threads containing &#34;licen{cs}e&#34; (just one thread) and &#34;licensing&#34; (many) in &#60;a href=&#34;http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2011/thread.html&#34;&#62;the list of threads from the 2011 Technical Council list archives&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The conclusion was to &#60;a href=&#34;http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Council-licensing&#34;&#62;license everything under two licenses&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Here's a link to the license that was used for Taporware (I worked on the TAPoR Portal but not Taporware). I believe this is custom language that was developed and approved by the IP office at McMaster: &#60;a href=&#34;http://taporware.ualberta.ca/~taporware/download/taporcopyright.txt&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://taporware.ualberta.ca/~taporware/download/taporcopyright.txt&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm wondering if any of you folks would be willing to share custom (software or content) licenses as well as IP agreements for your DH projects. I'm especially interested in what licenses people are using for code and why, as well as IP agreements that are used with research assistants, staff and other researchers. I'll post a few examples that we've used in a separate message below, but I'd be grateful to hear what others have been doing and why (as applicable).
