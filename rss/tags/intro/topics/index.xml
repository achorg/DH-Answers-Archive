			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello All,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I’m a historian who, after some years of teaching, has veered off the T-T seeking track but remains committed to research. The&#60;br /&#62;
plethora of innovative current DH projects has caused me to investigate entering the field, but I seem to have hit a snag. I'm strictly a historian, with no computing background. I've noticed that DH is a hot new training field for grad students, recent PhDs, or those with institutional affiliation, but what if, like me, you are further down the academic track, wanting to become trained or involved in these initiatives, *but* no longer affiliated with an institution?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Are there any specific paths or opportunities you would recommend to become involved in the field (say, in existing projects)? On a related note, how open is the field to humanists who are not, well, digital? While I've noted summer institutes or workshops, those seem geared to people already steeped in DH. In short, I’d value hearing your thoughts on gaining practical experience from a relatively outlier perspective. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What resources would you recommend for introducing librarians to what DH is and what it can do? Examples of DH/library projects would be great, as well as sites that explain field and link out to more resources? (other than ACH, of course!) thanks

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This fall I'm teaching a History of the Information Age, an undergraduate seminar.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's the course description:  &#34;This readings seminar will explore the history of new media and the digital age.  We will begin with an investigation of the various definitions of the Information Age, then move into a discussion of the historical &#38;amp; technological foundations of information production, computing devices, and communication and networking tools.  We will explore the social and cultural history of information production and consumption from newspapers to the Internet, from analog computational machines to handheld computers.  The course will generally be based in the history of the US, but, given the transfer of technology and the increasing ability of these technologies to transcend geographic regions, it will logically range more widely as appropriate.&#34;  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm creating a broad syllabus for the class with a few key readings and a big bibliography of primary and secondary texts, images, videos, films, etc.   The students in the class will select as a group the topics and readings we explore in more detail over the course of the semester.  I'm looking to expand the bibliography of potential sources that I've currently compiled at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/groups/infoage/items&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.zotero.org/groups/infoage/items&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[We will also, as a class, create a digital timeline of events, people, trends, ideas, concepts, linking to individual projects by students expanding on their particular areas of interest.  Any suggestions people have about small and large assignments (oral histories, infographics, short essay topics, mini-biographies, etc.) would also be welcome.]

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm super excited to be &#34;Introduction to Digital Humanities&#34; this fall. As I've been turning over the course in my mind, I've known that I've wanted to do one or more projects with the students, probably using our special collections, which tend to be quite strong in particular swaths of literature. This week I sat down with &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/LizChaseMARBL&#34;&#62;Liz Chase&#60;/a&#62;, one of our special collections librarians, and brainstormed. We came up with a great project involving &#60;a href=&#34;http://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/duffy834/?keywords=duffy&#34;&#62;our holdings of Carol Ann Duffy's notebooks&#60;/a&#62;. In short, we want to do some comparisons between how she writes in her 1999 volume, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Wife-Carol-Ann-Duffy/dp/057119995X/briacrox-20&#34;&#62;The World's Wife&#60;/a&#62;, and her previous volumes. We're interested in thematic material, vocabulary she uses, poetic styles, and so forth. But as I've been working to design the project, I've come to realize that the students' work (to say nothing of my teaching) will be improved by the inclusion of some readings on textual scholarship along these lines. &#60;strong&#62;But I don't know this field at all.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What's more, I've been trying to think about what sort of software we might most profitably use to help push our analysis after creating a dataset of the texts. I'm guessing we'll want to represent word counts, word clouds, line structures, and more. My first thought is &#60;a href=&#34;http://seasr.org/&#34;&#62;SEASR&#60;/a&#62;, but I'm not familiar with the tool and I'm not sure if it's overkill or underkill or totally off the mark. I can always use &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.wordle.net/&#34;&#62;Wordle&#60;/a&#62;, but I would like to have more options. And perhaps if I really knew this field of scholarship then it would be easier for me to know which tools I should be using.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;What I really need, then, is a suggestion of books or articles that I should read so that our class proceeds thoughtfully on the project with an understanding of what's been done in the past. Any tool suggestions would be welcome as well.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hey folks,&#60;br /&#62;
In response to some recent discussions about access to information about digital humanities from folks working in the cultural heritage sector, I decided to provide a quick start guide for those interested in finding more information about things digital that might relate to cultural heritage.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This list is only meant to be a starting point, and in no way final, definitive, or proscriptive. I am cross-posting this to DH Answers so that it can grow there in a forum setting and be more open. (If interested, you can read &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfortynine.org/2011/01/navigating-dh-for-cultural-heritage-professionals/&#34;&#62; &#60;/a&#62;)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Please add &#60;/strong&#62; to this and pass this around to your colleagues who do not follow DH'ers.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Find a &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org/&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Join a Museum Tech Association&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mcn.edu/&#34;&#62;Museum Computer Network&#60;/a&#62; is a friendly association of GLAM and DH professionals. MCN sponsors a listserv, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mcn.edu/mcn-l&#34;&#62;MCN-L&#60;/a&#62;, and its website provides a number of good resources available to anyone.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;American Association of Museum's &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/&#34;&#62;Media and Technology standing professional committee&#60;/a&#62;: This SPG sponsors tech-related sessions at AAM and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/muse/index.html&#34;&#62;MUSE awards&#60;/a&#62; that highlight exemplar uses of technology in museum galleries and in digital formats.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Attend technology-focused sessions at GLAM conferences&#60;br /&#62;
If you are not working in your institution's tech department, you can still attend sessions at a LAM conference. More tech-focused sessions are available at regional museum association meetings and professional conferences, and sometimes there are some strategy sessions that offer project management assistance or advise for choosing appropriate tools for specific projects.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digital-jumpstart.org/index.php/Topics&#34;&#62; Digital-JumpStart&#60;/a&#62;: sessions from NCPH and AAM 2010, offered opportunities for individuals to to benefit from the lessons learned by those more experienced in the field, and left a legacy with a wiki of resources on all kinds of GLAM-related topics.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.imls.gov/about/webwise.shtm&#34;&#62;Webwise&#60;/a&#62;: sponsored by the Institute for Museum and Library Services where representatives&#60;br /&#62;
of museums, libraries, archives, systems science, education, and&#60;br /&#62;
other fields interested in the future of online content for inquiry and learning. Conference is free.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://archimuse.com/conferences/mw.html&#34;&#62;Museums and the Web&#60;/a&#62;: Not everyone can afford to attend Museums and the Web, or may feel that they are not tech-savvy enough to attend, but you can read most papers presented at the conference online for free.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Review Award-winning Museum Media/Technology Projects&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/muse/index.html&#34;&#62;MUSE Awards&#60;/a&#62;, sponsored by AAM's Media and Technology Committee.&#60;/li&#62;

&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Subscribe to Blogs&#60;br /&#62;
There are too many good blogs for me to list here, but I will recommend a few that can help you get started.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://musematic.net/&#34;&#62;Musematic&#60;/a&#62;: Written by members of AAM's Media and Technology standing professional committee.&#60;/li&#62;

&#60;/a&#62;written by Carnegie Mellon University's Center for Arts Management and Technology.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/&#34;&#62;Digital Humanities Now&#60;/a&#62; created by Dan Cohen and Jeremy Boggs at the&#60;a href=&#34;http://chnm.gmu.edu&#34;&#62; Center for History and New Media&#60;/a&#62;, is a real-time, crowdsourced publication. If you don't use Twitter, this helps pull out what people are talking about by taking the pulse of the digital humanities community and tries to discern what articles, blog posts, projects, tools, collections, and announcements are worthy of greater attention.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Participate in Online Forums&#60;br /&#62;
Most technology projects host forums for help questions (ie, &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/forums&#34;&#62;Omeka&#60;/a&#62;), but there are also some general forums that can be very helpful too.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers&#34;&#62;DH Answers&#60;/a&#62; is building a community-based Q&#38;amp;A board for digital humanities questions that need a longer answer than Twitter provides.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Experiment with Digital Tools&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://digitalresearchtools.pbworks.com/w/page/17801672/FrontPage&#34;&#62;Digital Research Tools wiki (DiRT)&#60;/a&#62;: DiRT is a good starting place for browsing summaries and reviews of scores of digital tools for you to play with or think about trying for a new project.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Take a Webinar&#60;br /&#62;
Some webinars are free, others are not. They all offer training and varying levels of interaction that occur at your desktop and do not require travel.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62; &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.oclc.org/research/events/taichi.htm&#34;&#62;OCLC TAI CHI&#60;/a&#62; series highlights innovative applications that libraries, museums and archives may find effective in their own environments, and teaches new technologies and skills.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;AAM offers a variety of &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.aam-us.org/getinvolved/learn/ondemandwebinars.cfm&#34;&#62;professional development through webinars&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* Participate on Twitter&#60;br /&#62;
Getting started on Twitter may seem overwhelming and may not be practical given your daily responsibilities at your institution. If you're interested in following some folks before participating yourself, here are a few lists to get you going. (Not sure &#60;a href=&#34;http://digital-jumpstart.org/index.php/Social_Media&#34;&#62;how to get started on Twitter&#60;/a&#62;?)&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking to have my students collaboratively create a DH tool over the course of a semester. Are there any good introductory, practical texts on text markup, tagging or coding for DH projects? I'm basically looking to have them create a tool that will allow users to rearrange literary works creatively according to specific tags.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm currently working on a hypertext introductory program for advertising students.  I'm trying to steer clear of vertical transmission mode of teaching in favour of a more practise-focused, self-directed approach. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far I've found the teaching notes of Adrian Miles (&#60;a href=&#34;http://vogmae.net.au/research/thinking/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://vogmae.net.au/research/thinking/&#60;/a&#62;) and &#34;The Future of Learning&#34; (&#60;a href=&#34;http://startl.org/about/the-future-of-learning/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://startl.org/about/the-future-of-learning/&#60;/a&#62;) to be really useful.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have any recommended texts, thoughts, exercises or tips on how to go about this?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks guys!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Can anyone recommend good readings on the principles (and perhaps practices) of good interface design? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My students are creating a single-screen web interface made of photos and text; users click on what appeals and are taken to that content. They then are presented with another interface that lets them make subsequent selections.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd like to give them something shorter than a book, although I'd be interested in book recs, too.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd appreciate any suggestions -- thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;We're in the process of launching the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative at Michigan State University. the initiative is essentially a platform for supporting &#38;amp; encouraging cultural heritage informatics in the MSU community (and beyond). One of the big components of the initiative is a fellowship program. Essentially the program will allow grad students (both MA and PhD - in a wide variety of programs) to work on a project over the course of a year - the whole &#34;hacking/building as a way of knowing/learning&#34; thing.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;These fellows will most likely have very little digital experience.  So, I'm looking for a base list of publications/reports/resources that they can dive into in order to give them a kick start in the domain.  These pubs/reports/resources are intended to provide a snapshot of what is out there, what is possible, innovative implementations across a broad variety of domains/systems/platforms/etc.  These could be high level (the 10,000 foot view) or focused on a specific domain or platform (mobile, games, etc,)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm going to include things like the Horizon Report (in its various incarnations) as well as the Smithsonian's various digital reports/plans.  These should be less technical (they will drill into the technical considerations once they decide upon a problem/project/platform that want to work on).  I'm (of course) include a variety of serious game/meaningful pay reports/pubs.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for some additional suggestions for what I should include. Thoughts?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm teaching a intro survey course for MA students and wondering if I should spend a lot of time on HTML or move directly into XML. I'm torn on this. On the one hand starting with HTML allows me to ease students into understanding the web. On the other hand so many youth learn HTML in high school. Is it time to move on?
