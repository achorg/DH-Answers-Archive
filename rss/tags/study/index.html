			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is a very good question, but one that gets tricky very fast. For instance, a seemingly simple phrase like &#34;a job within the field&#34; (of digital humanities) is difficult to define.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Employers &#34;out there&#34; aren't (yet) looking for digital humanists since that's a label that's only starting to gain momentum in academia. On the other hand, there's any number employers looking for humanists of various stripes, and the technical skills that you already have may very well seem like a strong additional asset (something to differentiate you from most of the other applicants).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Within academia there have been several job ads recently for people with digital humanities competencies, though often the technical expectations are relatively high. You can get a sense of the diversity of jobs in the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.hastac.org/forum/23&#34;&#62;HASTAC Fellowship and Employment Opportunities&#60;/a&#62; forum.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for options for grad school, a good starting point is &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/is-there-a-list-anywhere-of-all-the-graduate-programs-that-study-dh&#34;&#62;this thread&#60;/a&#62; on DHAnswers.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As with most jobs and careers, it's very useful to start networking early and often. If you can make it to a &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcamp.org/&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62; or DH Conference like &#60;a href=&#34;https://dh2011.stanford.edu/&#34;&#62;DH2011&#60;/a&#62;, you'll get a better sense of what opportunities may be available and you'll meet some very interesting folks. Good luck!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am a Senior at the University of Mary Washington and have taken a couple of courses that look more into the field of Digital Humanities. Two of them being Digital History and Digital Storytelling. Unfortunately I am coming to that time where I have to start thinking about my future. I was wondering what kind of options are out there for those interested in the field of Digital Humanities. Would I need to go to graduate school to have a chance at finding a job within the field? Or do I have the basic skills I already need/ Are there internships or other programs that also support the field of Digital Humanities? I am actually more so interested in History because that is where I will get my bachelors. However I am open to any kind of advice. Thank you!

&#60;p&#62;You are right, it is a difficult search. I may have, perhaps, misstated the object of my search. I am in fact looking for a graduate programme of any kind that deals with digital culture/art/literature from a theoretical perspective. I have an undergraduate degree and I thought it would make sense to aim for graduate programmes. It is my understanding that I can apply for either master's programmes or doctoral programmes, but I assumed that it would be easier to be admitted to a master's. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I also need funding in order to study abroad, in any form, whether it be a scholarship or tuition waiver or some scheme in which I can work or do research in order to support myself.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Perhaps I should have made  myself clearer from the beginning. The sort of research I aim to do is best described in this (soon to be published) text: &#60;a href=&#34;http://mariuslobontiu.ro/2010/09/playing-the-text-a-call-for-theory-in-digital-fiction/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://mariuslobontiu.ro/2010/09/playing-the-text-a-call-for-theory-in-digital-fiction/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much for your help.

&#60;p&#62;It is in fact a lifelong dream of mine to study in London. I just assumed that funding options were far more limited than in the US, so I thought it would be more realistic to just apply there. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I see that the programme you suggest has quite a comprehensive list of scolarships and international student funding, so I will definitely apply (in spite of the fact that it is not 100% what I was looking for - but it is close enough). I will also start looking for other post-graduate programmes in or around London that deal with digital culture/literature/art. Thank you very much for your suggestion!

&#60;p&#62;Thank you for your answer. I am in fact looking for a master's in which to study digital art and literature from a theoretical perspective, rather than library and information science. I apologize if my initial question was misleading, and, again, thank you.

&#60;p&#62;Thank you very much for your suggestions. I am indeed more interested in studying digital art and fiction. I have been trying the exact approach you mention for quite some time (googling DH and its synonyms) but I haven't found as many programmes as I had hoped. That's why I turned to this forum (and I'm very glad I did!).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So far I've been taking the centres listed here ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/&#60;/a&#62; ) one by one, hoping to find a post-graduate programme associated with them. It's going slow and I'm not sure if this is the right list to start from. Is there any other list that you might know of, that would be helpful?

&#60;p&#62;From my discussions with the co-director of the program, it is my understanding that LUC's program is terminal based. The intention is to prepare students to work in careers in DH. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That being said, my interest in the program is as a gateway to my PhD in English. My interests are in textual studies, more specifically serial publications in Victorian England. A program such as this gives options either furthering education afterward or getting right into the field.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm building a Zotero collection focused on DH undergraduate, masters, and PhD programs.  It's a little rough, but you may find some useful information in it: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities_education/items/collection/2950956&#34;&#62;http://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities_education/items/collection/2950956&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;It's hard for me to wrap my head around the concept of &#34;Digital Humanities&#34; as a stand-alone master's degree program.  It seems to me that it would make more sense to go to a graduate program (history, English, art history, etc.) that has a progressive view toward technology applications in those disciplines.  Both programs listed (UCL/Loyola-Chicago) seem to me more like professional degrees than humanities degrees that involved a great deal technology applied to scholarly endeavors.

&#60;p&#62;Though this is a list of undergraduate programs with DH inflection, it might help to see if any of these also offer graduate programs:&#60;/p&#62;
