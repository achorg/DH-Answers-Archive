			<description>&#60;p&#62;In the early 2000s, a colleague and good friend used her HTML coding experience as her ONLY language other than English for her PhD at University of North Carolina ay Greensboro. When I did my PhD work at the same school in the early 1980s, I was required to take two graduate level French classes. . . so there is precedent at this one university in NC accepting coding. . . .

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks Amanda and Jennifer - I've updated the Zotero collection. I've remembered that this topic is (very) closely related to the broader issue of evaluation and review, so people stumbling across this question might also like to have a look at content in &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/WU6FDQC7&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/WU6FDQC7&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/&#60;/a&#62; (Vol. 1, No.4, 2012).

			<description>&#60;p&#62;If you haven't done so already, you might consider the resources available from Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, &#34; an international organization dedicated to promoting the adoption, creation, use, dissemination, and preservation of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs)&#34;.  Their website is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.ndltd.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.ndltd.org/&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And Liza Potts from Michigan State University and Kathie Gossett from Iowa State University received a 2012 Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for &#34;Building an Open-Source Archive for Born-Digital Dissertations.&#34; They hosted a &#34;three-day workshop to explore relevant issues and identify requirements for the development of an archive for the preservation of dissertations that incorporate interactive or dynamic digital media.&#34;  Their entry in the NEH database is &#60;a href=&#34;https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&#38;amp;gn=HD-51561-12&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&#38;amp;gn=HD-51561-12&#60;/a&#62; and the video of their lightning round talk at the NEH project directors meeting where they describe their project is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahuULHlcsoU#t=9m27s&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahuULHlcsoU#t=9m27s&#60;/a&#62; .  Eventually, they will post a white paper evaluating their project activities.  In the meantime, I'm sure that either of these two scholars would be happy to discuss their project with you.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for starting this collection, James! The following aren't specific dissertations, but some resources both discussing new models for dissertations as well as mentioning specific digital dissertation projects:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;#digdiss and #SCIGradEd (Scholarly Communication Institute's “Rethinking Humanities Graduate Education” work)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;#SCIGradEd released a report and additional resources, many of which touch on the dissertation: &#60;a href=&#34;http://uvasci.org/current-work/graduate-education/rethinking-grad-ed-oct-2012/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://uvasci.org/current-work/graduate-education/rethinking-grad-ed-oct-2012/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've started a Zotero collection here &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/KAIJQCCV&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/KAIJQCCV&#60;/a&#62; with a few items, but am generally just keen to hear about any policies, processes or successfully completed digital dissertations / theses. This could include humanities dissertations presented as websites, multi-media products etc. It might also include hybrid models, where the candidate presents both a traditional print output and associated digital ones.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This has come up in my graduate program as well (English at the University of Victoria, home to the Digital Humnities Summer Institute). Reception has been lukewarm, but I came across the Claremont Graudate University's interesting idea of requiring what they call &#34;Language and Research Tools.&#34; &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For the PhD in History, &#34;the student must demonstrate proficiency in two foreign languages or in one foreign language and an approved research tool . . . . With the advisor’s approval, a PhD student may substitute the second language requirement with Digital Humanities or oral history.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;See: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cgu.edu/pages/8200.asp&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.cgu.edu/pages/8200.asp&#60;/a&#62; in the middle of the page. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The  English PhD has similar language, although the 'research tool' option is limited to digital humanities. See &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cgu.edu/pages/8210.asp&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.cgu.edu/pages/8210.asp&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The University of Guelph PhD in Literary Studies/Theatre Studies in English Writes that &#34;In certain cases, students' research may require demonstrable competency in a non-written or technical language such as a programming language. The selection of the language(s) will be determined by the student in consultation with the dissertation advisor, and must be submitted for approval by the Graduate Studies Committee.&#34; there doesn't seem to be an accepted (or at least outlined) method for assessing a programming language. See: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/graduate/current/gradprog/sets-phd.shtml&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/graduate/current/gradprog/sets-phd.shtml&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;UC Santa Cruz has similar language on the website for the PhD in Film and Digital Media: &#60;a href=&#34;http://film.ucsc.edu/phd_program/requirements&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://film.ucsc.edu/phd_program/requirements&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thinking about this in relation to the above, it seems like there might be precedent in in History for considering various specializations (oral history, quantitative methods), as well as in Linguistics. Personally, I really like Claremont's research tools idea, given the justifications that have bee explicitly put forth for reasons why multiple languages are required, ie, to be useful in primary research settings.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I did my PhD work at UCIrvine where they accepted Stats or work in another discipline as one of the languages for the doctorate.  However, in 2005 when I asked to use a programming language, I was told no.  So I opted to learn the &#34;language of Anthropology&#34; instead (which meant 5 classes in Anth and a 40-page paper demonstrating how I would use what I learned in my research). Last year I was told that they would now consider a programming language to fulfill that requirement.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There's some precedent for allowing knowledge of statistics, if not programming, to replace foreign languages in history programs. I know from word-of-mouth that the Princeton history department used to allow 'quantitative methods' to displace one required language. No one had used it in years, and it seems to have disappeared from the program guidelines.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Searching for that, I see that the Michigan Grad program history allows &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/history/Home/Graduate/The%20Gray%20Book/2011%20Gray%20Book.pdf&#34;&#62;quantitative methods/statistics (pdf at link)&#60;/a&#62; competency to displace a single language requirement. There they require formal coursework in statistics.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I think what's important in Mike's piece and Stefan's reply is that it will call for some careful thinking-through -- beyond a switcheroo.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I blogged about similar stuff &#60;a href=&#34;http://hackingthehumanities.org/node/28&#34;&#62;thinking about alt-ac training&#60;/a&#62;, but in terms of minors.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I think that selling a programming language competency is already a big enough challenge, but truth be told, I'd rather see a technical competency that necessarily relies on whatever language(s) the student prefers.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, for instance, instead of sitting down to write a Java program to determine word frequencies in a collection of 1,000 texts, it would be more like this: take the plain text version of Hamlet from Gutenberg and write code to automate the conversion of it to a very, very simple TEI representation, ensuring that character names are identified in elements separately from their speeches. Presumably to do that you would need to know pattern matching (regular expressions), loops, data structures, etc. (ideally you'd write your own functions, but if you didn't, does that really matter? I'd take a very pragmatic approach: complete a task without worrying too much about how the code looks (if you coding is a central aspect of the research activities for the student, they'll be plenty of opportunity to learn best practices).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In any case, I'd probably put more emphasis on data pre-processing than on building analytic tools because I think the first kind of activity is under-estimated (even if there's lots of room for better analytic and visualization tools to be built). Rarely do we find shrink-wrapped data sets that are ready for use without some manipulation and preparation. In that context, I think some basic programming competencies can be very useful, to not say indispensable, for many kinds of digital methodologies.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've proposed to the Graduate Studies Committee that literacy in writing code should fulfill one of the English PhD program's two foreign-language requirements.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Is there precedent, on an institutional level, for this move? What standards should we use to measure &#34;literacy&#34;?

&#60;p&#62;Hi! I wasn't in an English department, but did do some literary studies for my PhD.  I don't actually have a preilm reading list (long story), but &#60;a href=&#34;http://rolandht.org/xml/bibliography.php&#34;&#62;here's my bibliography&#60;/a&#62;.
