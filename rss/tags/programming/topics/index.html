			<description>&#60;p&#62;We have a DH project that's currently uses MySQL for the database, and it works very well.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There has been much recent talk about NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB, promising flexibility and scalability. We're considering re-writing the backend. Is anyone in the DH community seriously using MongoDB?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you have used MongoDB for a DH project, what has been your experience with it? Biggest joy? Gotchas to look out for? Is conversion worth it for libraries and archives open source projects?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Over at the &#60;a href=&#34;http://programminghistorian.org/&#34;&#62;Programming Historian&#60;/a&#62;, we're seeking to add to our collection of lessons, which already covers things like grabbing text from webpages, counting word frequencies, and the basics of topic modeling. We have a lot of ideas about what other lessons we might provide, but we thought we'd ask first: What do you want to learn?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As a humanist (you don't need to be a historian), are there some specific programming tasks you'd like to perform? What are they?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(We find that the lessons work best when they're targeted at accomplishing a particular task, so the more specific the better!)
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have a long history of technical work in DH (mainly XML related). I've been working as a manager for a couple of years and although I still get to do some coding I'd like to sharpen my skills, and maybe learn something new. I'm particularly interested in tools for working with XML documents, and in website development. I have taken a couple of courses through my university's IT services (perl and python), they offer other courses too but three hours really isn't enough time to get much out of it and there's no follow-up. I've also done some of the codeacademy tutorials but again it's not really enough to do much with. Maybe I just need to do more of them? I have access to Lynda.com, which seems to be chock full of courses but that is a bit overwhelming. Ideally I would take a web development course of some sort at the U. but my life and work schedule doesn't make that a very good option right now. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Anyone with experience with Lynda.com, maybe recommendations on where to start? Or are there other options available I'm not aware of? Thanks so much DHers!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi, does anyone know of any resources for teaching a short unit of a larger DH course on programming for graduate students? I'd like students to have basic skills in HTML/CSS/Python - but maybe that's asking too much. Any strategies?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is stretching the mandate of this forum a bit, but I'm wondering if anyone has experience in introducing computer programming to kids and has resources to recommend. I'm as familiar as one might be with things like &#60;a href=&#34;http://scratch.mit.edu/&#34;&#62;Scratch&#60;/a&#62; following some quick searches, but I'm wondering if there are some first-hand accounts of what worked and what didn't at different ages. For instance, I'd be very interested in how to introduce programming concepts without using a computer (kinetic activities).

				<title>Stéfan Sinclair on "Teaching Programming in a CMS"</title>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I teach a programming fundamentals class in our undergraduate Multimedia programme, and I'm considering doing most of the course within a content management system. In some ways this is a bit absurd, but I think working in a CMS is useful experience for the students, and too often I see students thinking they should start websites from scratch instead of leveraging the power and functionality of a CMS.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My first instinct is to use WordPress, in part because I think it's a good compromise of power and ease (it will be relatively easy for students to install and start using), and in part because I think it's likely to be the most useful platform for them to learn (at least in a first instance). The trouble is that it doesn't seem especially well-suited to experimenting with PHP and Javascript, particularly at the post level (the template level is another story). It looks like it's possible to configure the editor to accept additional tags and plugins to allow PHP, but it seems quite awkward. Maybe I just wasn't able to find the right documentation for WordPress 3.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For my own stuff I've used Drupal more extensively, and it seems better suited for experimenting with in-post code, but I'm not sure I want to throw Drupal at students who are just beginning to grapple with code and CMS.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For the benefits of syntax colouring, debugging, and so on, I'll probably have students write most of their code in an external editor, but I'm keen on having them post their work in a way that can be experienced directly in the CMS. I realize that in-post coding is not the most common scenario, but am I missing obvious something in WordPress? Should I be considering something else (that will also be useful to students)?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;BTW, the overall objectives for the course are to have them develop strategies for solving programming problems and to gain experience building dynamic websites. Many will be starting with little to no programming experience.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Signed,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Pedagogically Conflicted (again)

						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/whats-wrong-with-python#post-117</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A collaborator I worked with a few years ago was in love with python.  According to him, python's strictly regimented syntax and its indentation requirements essentially forced good coding practices on people while providing a powerful engine for Doing Things.  To my collaborator, using it was as freeing as some people consider constrained writing to be.  Plus, I hear it's sometimes used to take advantage of the Java environment without having to learn Java.  So it's been in the back of my mind as a language I'd like to learn when an appropriate project presents itself.  (I'm terrible at learning programming by doing exercises.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Then yesterday, on Twitter, one of my DH friends said &#34;friends don't let friends program python.&#34;  What's that about?  Is it a matter of personal preference, or are there functions that we often need in DH but that python is unable to provide?  Or is there something else I need to know about it, a lurking dark secret?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And related, I guess: what programming language have you found to be the most versatile, in your DH work?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
