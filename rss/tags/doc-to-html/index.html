			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello, you can also try our Doc To HTML Converter [www.doctohtml.com], which converts MS Word documents into clean &#34;web&#34; (X)HTML. It does not use MS Word built-in conversion engine at all, and performs conversion entirely on its own, although using MS Word to access the original document, thus delivering the best possible HTML code.&#60;br /&#62;
The program requires MS Word 2000+ to be installed.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;My best is to copy from Word and 'paste special' into the design view of Dreamweaver. Then do clean up HTML. Then find and replace special characters in code view. Still tedious, but pretty good results.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;well, whether mr textfixer is the best answer probably depends what you're actually trying to do... if you're happy to throw away all your images and most of the structure of your word file, and if no-one has managed to get you to update to more recent versions of microsoft office, and if you're happy to go on working with the web circa 1997, then yup, it's a pretty good answer. otherwise, no.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Have you tried the ox garage engine? &#60;a href=&#34;http://oxgarage.oucs.ox.ac.uk&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://oxgarage.oucs.ox.ac.uk&#60;/a&#62;  -- it makes a pretty good fist of converting between doc, docx, odt, html, tei and various other formats. in both directions!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Dreamweaver has had a &#34;clean up Word HTML&#34; feature for several years.   I wouldn't recommend buying the program for this purpose but if you can get access to a copy, it might be worthwhile testing a problematic document.&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The only text constructs Word understands are paragraph-level elements and spans of characters.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The way we coped with text structures larger than a paragraph (such as a list) back when I was working in typesetting/SGML was to make sure that those structures actually had at least four associated Word paragraph styles. Using a list as example (but the same idea works for abstracts, block quotations, etc.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;one for the first item in a list (visually: extra space on top)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;one for a middle list item&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;one for a final list item (visually: extra space below)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;and one for a one-item list (visually: extra space above and below)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Clunky though this undoubtedly is, getting markup out of it is relatively painless. It does get even uglier when you have multi-paragraph list items... but that's fortunately rather rare.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Oxygen was worth trying and would certainly be useful for other things, but Word just isn't being cooperative enough – the way it treats bulleted lists as styled paragraphs, for instance. Which means that, like you, I'm back to regex in a text editor.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;My first thought was to clean it up semi manually using regular expressions in a good text editor like BBEdit, TextMate, or oXygen (the latter is my tool of choice given its XML etc. savviness).  I've done this many times, but it was always painful.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;But a new feature of oXygen XML Editor v12.1 comes to mind:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;Smart Paste - Automatic Conversion to DITA, DocBook, TEI, etc.&#60;br /&#62;
Styled content can be inserted by copying content from Office applications (for example Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice.org Writer and OpenOffice.org Calc) and Web browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.) and pasting it in the Author editor. The styles and general layout of the copied content, like sections with headings, tables, list items, bold and italic text, hyperlinks, are converted in the target document equivalent XML elements. &#38;lt;oXygen/&#38;gt; provides default implementations for the following document types: DITA, DocBook, TEI, XHTML but this support can be configured also for user defined document types.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So the idea would be to open the Word HTML file in a web browser, copy the desired text, then paste it into a new XHTML document in oXygen's Author mode.  Haven't tried it with this combination of source and destination formats, but I was pleased with the results when I pasted generic web content into a new TEI file.  May be promising for you.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Another way to come at the problem might be to use something like &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/&#34;&#62;Beautiful Soup&#60;/a&#62; to pull out the signal from the noise and recast it as non-horrible HTML?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the suggestion on cleaning MS Word HTML.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I was hoping I would be able to report back that opening the Word Document in Open/LibreOffice and exporting as HTML would be more successful, but alas no. How do you say &#34;oh well&#34; in latin? :)

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Lasciate ogni speranza... um, that isn't helpful, is it?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You might have a look at Peter Sefton's &#60;a href=&#34;http://ice.usq.edu.au/introduction/about.htm&#34;&#62;ICE-RS&#60;/a&#62; environment. Even if you don't adopt it wholesale, there may be some tricks you can borrow.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm curious if anyone is particularly pleased with their method of cleaning Word HTML files. There's any number of services based on HTML Tidy, some of which are integrated into editors like TextWrangler and TextMate, but I still find I need to do some further clean up and correction, especially with lists (any tool would need to know specifics about the peculiar way Word exports lists into HTML). Someone &#60;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/67964/what-is-the-best-free-way-to-clean-up-word-html&#34;&#62;mentioned&#60;/a&#62; publishing from Word to a blog entry, but I'm not sure if that's possible in Word for Mac.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any further suggestions (aside from avoiding Word)?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>
