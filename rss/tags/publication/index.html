			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Dan,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The &#34;freemium&#34; business model, when applied to publishing, often works out the way you describe: a version of the work is freely available to read online, perhaps even under a Creative Commons or other open license, but more convenient versions (like ebooks and print versions) are available for purchase.  Some titles in OpenEdition and OAPEN are available this way, and DOAB points to many others.  We use this model for titles published under the digitalculturebooks imprint: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalculture.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.digitalculture.org/&#60;/a&#62; , and Utah State University Press makes titles available in HathiTrust ( &#60;a href=&#34;http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?a=listis;c=869533047&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?a=listis;c=869533047&#60;/a&#62; ), with the full view including a &#34;buy a copy&#34; link.  For others, see:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;* &#60;a href=&#34;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Dual-edition_publishing&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Dual-edition_publishing&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
* &#60;a href=&#34;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Tiered_quality&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_book_business_models#Tiered_quality&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;As for open content selling well, some evidence has shown that it has helped sales, while others see no impact on sales.  We at Michigan are unaware of any evidence that it hurts sales; our digitalculturebooks titles are among the University of Michigan Press titles that sell best despite being freely available to read online.  For more, see:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=(&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.google.com/search?q=(&#60;/a&#62;&#34;open+access&#34;+OR+OA)+effect+sales&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In case it helps, here's an example of supplementary material that was never included in the print edition of the book (even as a CD-ROM):&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/r/ramsey/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/r/ramsey/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;By the way, if I were Google, I would also accept only paper, PDF/A-1b, or PDF/A-2b as input.  There are fewer variables on input (like page size and the number of colors per page) than if you start accepting people's digital files.  It's kind of like how Google only wants to crawl webpages and PDFs: you can offer them all sorts of structured metadata, but they're just going to use their standard algorithms anyway.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;â€”Kevin

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm in discussions with a press about a second edition of a 100k word edition of an Old English poem. I'm pushing for an open, on-line release of the text with Print-on-Demand and ePub sales from the site. Since the introduction is frequently cited, and is available in part on Google Books already (ironically for a print-and-CD-ROM digital edition, Google just scanned the print copy), my argument is the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) People who are really in the market for a 100k word book on a 9-line poem are going to want to buy a copy in a format they can annotate, read off line, and that is generally more pleasing on the eye than a standard web-page (you'd be surprised how many people have wanted a copy in the last 8 years!)&#60;br /&#62;
2) People who are prepared to put up with poorer-quality, long-form presentation because they can get it for free on-line are basically already being lost to the Google Books site&#60;br /&#62;
3) Putting the whole argument and text out on the web will help keep the book central to debates in the field, presumably increasing the number of people buying copies under argument 1 above.&#60;br /&#62;
4) Reprinting a book+CD-ROM digital text today captures the worst of all worlds: we miss the exposure on-line publication provides via search engines and we lock the most flexible format (the digital) in a medium that is increasingly difficult to use and is certainly not multi-platform.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I can think of one somewhat parallel case that seems to show these arguments: Peter Baker's Introduction to Old English which, I am told, has sold very well through the years even though it has always been freely available on-line in a version that, if anything, is actually more feature-rich than the print copy. Does anybody know of any other examples?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some background: the edition was published in 2005 in a Print-and-CD-ROM, where the CD-ROM contained the full text of the print book and additional views, tools, and features. The edition itself has done better than you might think for a pretty long edition of a 9-line poem (I believe it sold through 3+ print runs) and it was runner up for MLA's best edition in 2007 (first medieval edition and I believe first digital to be so recognised). What I want to do now is publish a revised version of the contents of the CD-ROM to the web and offer POD copies and ePubs of the book content for sale from the site. My theory is that they are likely to sell for much the same reason the book sold in the first place: people use digital texts but given the choice they are still happy doing long-form reading in a format that is better suited to it that the browser.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any advice? Parallel examples? Other ideas?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;1. How do you (and people you know) go about finding technical &#34;books&#34;? Do brick-and-mortar bookstores play much of a role?&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I occasionally browse the tech section in books-and-mortar bookstores, but rarely buy technical books from them. I do have tropisms toward certain technical publishers I know to be reliable, and certain authors I find comprehensible.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;    &#60;em&#62;2. Be honest, would you judge a self-published technical book to be less trustworthy or authoritative than one published by a well-known publisher?&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Even the tech publishers I love best sometimes publish complete turkeys. For me, tech-book purchases are purely instrumental: does it teach something I need to know, in a manner I find learnable? If I bounce off the language (Michael Kay on XSLT) or find the approach too cutesy to stand (Head Start), that's that.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have a standing bookmark to &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.niche-canada.org/programming-historian&#34;&#62;The Programming Historian&#60;/a&#62; because it's good stuff. That it was originally self-published doesn't make a lick of difference to me.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;    &#60;em&#62;3. Are there &#34;publishers&#34; (loosely defined) or other publication-related organizations (like the Institute for the Future of the Book) that might be worth talking to about the possibility of making the work available under their umbrella, to help provide some of the credibility that traditional publication would provide?&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Certainly. Consider &#60;a href=&#34;http://openhumanitiespress.org/&#34;&#62;Open Humanities Press&#60;/a&#62;, &#60;a href=&#34;http://pressforward.org/&#34;&#62;PressForward&#60;/a&#62;, or even O'Reilly if you can interest them in it.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Elijah Meeks and I are working on writing &#34;Drupal for Humanists&#34;, with the goal of producing something that's relevant and readable for people ranging from undergrads and DH newbies to tech-savvy folks in DH, the library, and university IT. We were thinking of going the traditional find-a-publisher route, but there's some significant downsides, including:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Turning all rights over to the publisher&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;The near-impossibility of finding a publisher who'd be okay with Creative Commons licensing&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;The fact that some of the details of the content will go out of date quickly, and we won't be able to just update it freely&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We're thinking about just publishing it for free as a web-based version that we can expand and update at will, while offering a self-published print copy from a print-on-demand publisher for people who want to learn from &#34;a book&#34;. We could also make the print version available on Amazon. I like this plan on a number of levels, from convenience to ideology, but I'm wondering if it might fall short of achieving our goal of making something that lots of people actually use.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ol&#62;
&#60;li&#62;How do you (and people you know) go about finding technical &#34;books&#34;? Do brick-and-mortar bookstores play much of a role? (We almost certainly wouldn't be able to get into those.)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Be honest, would you judge a self-published technical book to be less trustworthy or authoritative than one published by a well-known publisher?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Are there &#34;publishers&#34; (loosely defined) or other publication-related organizations (like the Institute for the Future of the Book) that might be worth talking to about the possibility of making the work available under their umbrella, to help provide some of the credibility that traditional publication would provide?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Anything else we should be thinking about?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ol&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This question is really fascinating (especially since I suspect I have inkling of &#60;a href=&#34;http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/&#34;&#62;the sort of texts&#60;/a&#62; you're interested in). Let me just dump a handful of links which I think might be helpful from my recent delicious/pinboard (hmm... delicious pinboard).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While I can't point to specific results/papers. Aditi Muralidharan (@silverasm)'s WordSeer project is promising interesting results about slave narratives, though it does not rely on TEI. In &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aditi/projects/wordseer.html&#34;&#62;this talk&#60;/a&#62;, though, she does a good job of answering Sean's question directly--how can metadata improve on generic full-text search. WordSeer (as I understand it) works mostly by supplementing raw text with part of speech tagging and other grammatical metadata.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With respect to TEI specifically one obvious place to start, I think, is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.monkproject.org/&#34;&#62;MONK&#60;/a&#62;; as Dorothea notes, Martin Mueller is involved with the MONK project. You can find him summarizing MONK &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cocoon/tei2008/programme/abstracts/abstract-169.html&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62; and at greater length &#60;a href=&#34;https://apps.lis.illinois.edu/wiki/display/MONK/Notes+towards+a+user+manual+of+Monk&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;. Unlike WordSeer, the Monk Workbench gives you metadata about author (including gender) and publication date. Matt Kirschenbaum mentions MONK in &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~hillol/NGDM07/abstracts/talks/MKirschenbaum.pdf&#34;&#62;this article&#60;/a&#62; [PDF].&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(How relevant it will be to you, I don't know, but when I heard John Unsworth speak recently, he talked about the work flow and complications of large text collections with different encoding standards--with reference to MONK in particular. You can hear him &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.scholarslab.org/podcasts/unsworth-idiosyncrasy-at-scale/&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There was a &#60;a href=&#34;http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1104&#38;amp;L=TEI-L&#38;amp;F=&#38;amp;S=&#38;amp;O=T&#38;amp;H=0&#38;amp;D=0&#38;amp;T=1#34&#34;&#62;recent discussion&#60;/a&#62; on the TEI list about eXist from which I learned a lot--again, about what's possible rather than specific results/reports.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Finally--this one is also not TEI specific--if you haven't seen Ben Schmidt's blog, he is doing some pretty impressive stuff. This post, on &#60;a href=&#34;http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/04/age-cohort-and-vocabulary-use.html&#34;&#62;vocabulary use and age cohort&#60;/a&#62; gives some idea.

&#60;p&#62;There was a &#60;a href=&#34;http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1104&#38;amp;L=TEI-L&#38;amp;F=&#38;amp;S=&#38;amp;O=T&#38;amp;H=0&#38;amp;D=0&#38;amp;T=1#34&#34;&#62;recent discussion&#60;/a&#62; on the TEI list about eXist from which I learned a lot--again, about what's possible rather than specific results/reports.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Finally--again, not TEI specific--if you haven't seen Ben Schmidt's blog, he is doing some pretty impressive stuff. This post, on &#60;a href=&#34;http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/04/age-cohort-and-vocabulary-use.html&#34;&#62;vocabulary use and age cohort&#60;/a&#62; gives some idea.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I might sharpen the question further by trying to differentiate between texts that have digitally archived and those have been marked-up using the TEI standards.  That is, what kind of discoveries or scholarly innovations has the tagging process itself helped to create that wouldn't have been accessible to more generic full-text searching and/or processing?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;People to start with here would certainly include Martin Muller. The &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.nines.org/publications&#34;&#62;NINES project&#60;/a&#62; may also be a fruitful source.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I suggest, actually, that you dig up some TEI-encoded corpora and trace them through the literature. Offhand, the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.umich.edu/tcp/&#34;&#62;Text Creation Partnership&#60;/a&#62; and the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.wwp.brown.edu/&#34;&#62;Brown Women Writer's Project&#60;/a&#62; should have spawned a fair amount of scholarship by now.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello, DHers,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm writing a report on the TEI in literature, and I'm looking for &#34;discoveries&#34; made in your research using TEI-encoded texts. We've heard of research in the popular press utilizing Google's n-grams, as well as other &#34;text only&#34; archives. I'm looking for research/discoveries accomplished using the TEI standard specifically. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you've made such a discovery, what was it, and what program did you use/create in the making of said discovery? Was this research published? If not, why? If so, where did you publish? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you for your input!&#60;br /&#62;
M.
