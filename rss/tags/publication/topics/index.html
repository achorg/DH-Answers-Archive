			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm in discussions with a press about a second edition of a 100k word edition of an Old English poem. I'm pushing for an open, on-line release of the text with Print-on-Demand and ePub sales from the site. Since the introduction is frequently cited, and is available in part on Google Books already (ironically for a print-and-CD-ROM digital edition, Google just scanned the print copy), my argument is the following:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;1) People who are really in the market for a 100k word book on a 9-line poem are going to want to buy a copy in a format they can annotate, read off line, and that is generally more pleasing on the eye than a standard web-page (you'd be surprised how many people have wanted a copy in the last 8 years!)&#60;br /&#62;
2) People who are prepared to put up with poorer-quality, long-form presentation because they can get it for free on-line are basically already being lost to the Google Books site&#60;br /&#62;
3) Putting the whole argument and text out on the web will help keep the book central to debates in the field, presumably increasing the number of people buying copies under argument 1 above.&#60;br /&#62;
4) Reprinting a book+CD-ROM digital text today captures the worst of all worlds: we miss the exposure on-line publication provides via search engines and we lock the most flexible format (the digital) in a medium that is increasingly difficult to use and is certainly not multi-platform.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I can think of one somewhat parallel case that seems to show these arguments: Peter Baker's Introduction to Old English which, I am told, has sold very well through the years even though it has always been freely available on-line in a version that, if anything, is actually more feature-rich than the print copy. Does anybody know of any other examples?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some background: the edition was published in 2005 in a Print-and-CD-ROM, where the CD-ROM contained the full text of the print book and additional views, tools, and features. The edition itself has done better than you might think for a pretty long edition of a 9-line poem (I believe it sold through 3+ print runs) and it was runner up for MLA's best edition in 2007 (first medieval edition and I believe first digital to be so recognised). What I want to do now is publish a revised version of the contents of the CD-ROM to the web and offer POD copies and ePubs of the book content for sale from the site. My theory is that they are likely to sell for much the same reason the book sold in the first place: people use digital texts but given the choice they are still happy doing long-form reading in a format that is better suited to it that the browser.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any advice? Parallel examples? Other ideas?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Elijah Meeks and I are working on writing &#34;Drupal for Humanists&#34;, with the goal of producing something that's relevant and readable for people ranging from undergrads and DH newbies to tech-savvy folks in DH, the library, and university IT. We were thinking of going the traditional find-a-publisher route, but there's some significant downsides, including:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Turning all rights over to the publisher&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;The near-impossibility of finding a publisher who'd be okay with Creative Commons licensing&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;The fact that some of the details of the content will go out of date quickly, and we won't be able to just update it freely&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We're thinking about just publishing it for free as a web-based version that we can expand and update at will, while offering a self-published print copy from a print-on-demand publisher for people who want to learn from &#34;a book&#34;. We could also make the print version available on Amazon. I like this plan on a number of levels, from convenience to ideology, but I'm wondering if it might fall short of achieving our goal of making something that lots of people actually use.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ol&#62;
&#60;li&#62;How do you (and people you know) go about finding technical &#34;books&#34;? Do brick-and-mortar bookstores play much of a role? (We almost certainly wouldn't be able to get into those.)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Be honest, would you judge a self-published technical book to be less trustworthy or authoritative than one published by a well-known publisher?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Are there &#34;publishers&#34; (loosely defined) or other publication-related organizations (like the Institute for the Future of the Book) that might be worth talking to about the possibility of making the work available under their umbrella, to help provide some of the credibility that traditional publication would provide?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Anything else we should be thinking about?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ol&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This question is really fascinating (especially since I suspect I have inkling of &#60;a href=&#34;http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/&#34;&#62;the sort of texts&#60;/a&#62; you're interested in). Let me just dump a handful of links which I think might be helpful from my recent delicious/pinboard (hmm... delicious pinboard).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;While I can't point to specific results/papers. Aditi Muralidharan (@silverasm)'s WordSeer project is promising interesting results about slave narratives, though it does not rely on TEI. In &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aditi/projects/wordseer.html&#34;&#62;this talk&#60;/a&#62;, though, she does a good job of answering Sean's question directly--how can metadata improve on generic full-text search. WordSeer (as I understand it) works mostly by supplementing raw text with part of speech tagging and other grammatical metadata.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With respect to TEI specifically one obvious place to start, I think, is &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.monkproject.org/&#34;&#62;MONK&#60;/a&#62;; as Dorothea notes, Martin Mueller is involved with the MONK project. You can find him summarizing MONK &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cocoon/tei2008/programme/abstracts/abstract-169.html&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62; and at greater length &#60;a href=&#34;https://apps.lis.illinois.edu/wiki/display/MONK/Notes+towards+a+user+manual+of+Monk&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;. Unlike WordSeer, the Monk Workbench gives you metadata about author (including gender) and publication date. Matt Kirschenbaum mentions MONK in &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~hillol/NGDM07/abstracts/talks/MKirschenbaum.pdf&#34;&#62;this article&#60;/a&#62; [PDF].&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;(How relevant it will be to you, I don't know, but when I heard John Unsworth speak recently, he talked about the work flow and complications of large text collections with different encoding standards--with reference to MONK in particular. You can hear him &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.scholarslab.org/podcasts/unsworth-idiosyncrasy-at-scale/&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There was a &#60;a href=&#34;http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1104&#38;amp;L=TEI-L&#38;amp;F=&#38;amp;S=&#38;amp;O=T&#38;amp;H=0&#38;amp;D=0&#38;amp;T=1#34&#34;&#62;recent discussion&#60;/a&#62; on the TEI list about eXist from which I learned a lot--again, about what's possible rather than specific results/reports.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Finally--this one is also not TEI specific--if you haven't seen Ben Schmidt's blog, he is doing some pretty impressive stuff. This post, on &#60;a href=&#34;http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/04/age-cohort-and-vocabulary-use.html&#34;&#62;vocabulary use and age cohort&#60;/a&#62; gives some idea.
