			<description>&#60;p&#62;Where do you go for data to support your DH work aside from LAMs (library, archive, museum) specific repositories?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;...that is, what it is for. Not to ask about schools, but sorry, I am a librarian seeking to transition to working with digital humanities. Could I please just ask what training I really need for this? writing code only? Are there off the shelf systems for digital projects that require less technical training? if I could get some answers to these queries, I promise I won't bother you with FINDING the training. I need a better handle on what to look for myself. thanks.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My name is Brianna Marshall and I'm a graduate student working as a digital projects research assistant at the Indiana University Libraries. Over the summer, we began exploring Neatline as a platform to facilitate faculty DH projects. We've been in touch with the library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but beyond that we haven't heard much about other libraries using the tool. We've faced a significant number of roadblocks so far in working with Neatline so we definitely think it would be useful to get other libraries' perspectives. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If anyone knows of libraries using Neatline, please let me know! We'll appreciate it. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!&#60;br /&#62;
Brianna

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Correct me if I'm wrong, but most OPAC's and/or other search and discovery mechanisms land you squarely at the item level, lost in a sea of bibliographic monads, no? Hopefully the results will be arranged according to some kind of relevance criteria. Alas, outside of category-specific search and discovery tools (by item type or location in the library), we have hardly a global way of getting a macroscopic sense of bodies of knowledge. Say for example I was doing research on Marian iconography in 14th century France or Cuban elections at the end of the 19th century, and I wanted to see what relevant collections were available in New York. Now, say that CUNY, NYPL, NYU and Columbia had some microfilm, some digitized images, some books, some CD-Roms, some actual illuminated manuscripts, some journal articles on the subject, etc. Without determining &#60;em&#62;a priori&#60;/em&#62; the level of abstraction we are willing to endure, what steps, technical and political, do we need to take to have the tool that will allow me to know who has what at the macroscopic level? I  hear rumors of folks trying to solve this problem. Stand up and make yourself known!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What resources would you recommend for introducing librarians to what DH is and what it can do? Examples of DH/library projects would be great, as well as sites that explain field and link out to more resources? (other than ACH, of course!) thanks

			<description>&#60;p&#62;There is a lot of talk about the major disciplinary conferences like MLA and AHA having substantial increases in sessions devoted to digital humanities. I am worried/wondering why library associations like ALA (American Library Association) don't seem to be invested in this. Is this true or is it just my perception? Is ALA too big and maybe it is better recognized in the smaller divisions like ACRL (Association of College and Research Libraries)? If librarians are to be active partners in DH work, which professional organizations are supporting and investing in this area?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In 2009, writing in Digital Humanities Quarterly (DHQ), Christine L. Borgman asks the question: &#34;Where are the social studies of digital humanities?&#34; as part of an article entitled, &#34;The Digital Future is Now: A Call to Action for the Humanities&#34;. Borgman elaborates, &#34;Why is no one following digital humanities scholars around to understand their practices, in the way that scientists have been studied for the last several decades?  ... The humanities community should invite more social scientists as research partners and should make themselves available as objects of study. In doing so, the community can learn more about itself and apply the lessons to the design of tools, services, policies, and infrastructure.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This year I'm writing a Master's thesis with the current working title of &#34;Towards an Ethnography of the Digital Humanities: A Study of DH and the Future of Research Libraries&#34;.  My focus will be on the histories and futures of CHNM, MITH, and the Scholar's Lab.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any advice, suggested reading, or input is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am working with the Collingswood (NJ) Library on trying to improve access to maps, images and historical information in the collection. I have developed a rudimentary ARC-GIS application that calls up historic images of specific locations. Has any Digital Humanities member used this sort of application in their own library or archive?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm looking for libraries that are offering DH services. There's the &#60;a href=&#34;http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab&#34;&#62;Scholars' Lab&#60;/a&#62; of course, I believe UCLA is starting to. I'm interested not so much in extended consulting and software or project development, but in streamlined services to enable scholars to create things like digital editions or described collections of materials with minimal input from library staff. Thanks!
