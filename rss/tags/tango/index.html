&#60;p&#62;I hear you on this; and I don't think it has to be. It's as much teaching undergraduates* how to use the already effective tools that are out there -- how 18th century English Lit studies are changed by the accessibility of ECCO, EEBO, and the Burney Collection,** for example.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;*And even graduate students, staff, faculty, in some cases.&#60;br /&#62;
**Not that I'm blithely assuming that all colleges and unis have access to these tools.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I agree with you that interpretations of textual, visual, geographical, archaeological, etc. data within the humanities are digital humanities.  Almost everything I have done professionally or academically over the last six years has been DH, from GIS to 3D visualization to cultural heritage informatics.  I'm not going split hairs as to whether TEI and data mining are web-based or not, but I find myself increasingly frustrated by conversations about &#34;How do we teach/introduce students to DH,&#34; and all of the answers relate to some form of web development: designing a database schema, learning HTML/CSS.  These are things that are of limited usefulness in many humanities disciplines.  I understand that people will suggest skills based on their own experience, but DH is losing out a lot of experienced technologists and scholars from non-textual fields, and as I have observed DH becoming more and more narrowly focused, voices in the textual humanities fields have greater and greater influence (control, even) over what is or is not &#34;Digital Humanities.&#34;  That is why I suggest that people who call themselves digital humanists ought to reconsider their notion of DH.  I think the field is much bigger than they realize, and thus needs to be more inclusive.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @Ethan Gruber's &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-do-we-introduce-undergraduates-to-the-digital-humanities/page/2#post-1583&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have to say, I disagree with most, if not all, of this. There is plenty of coding work in DH that is not web-related. Text-mining and distant reading are examples, as is work encoding texts in TEI. I think I remember some very awesome visualizations of ancient architecture, too, that I would call non-web DH coding? :)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The thing that I disagree with most is the idea that we (counting myself as a digital humanist) need to rethink our notion of the Digital Humanities. Like the #transformDH hashtag, it is predicated on a set idea of DH that I do not think exists. It seems like less than a year ago that there was still very active discussion about the role of code in DH, what skills could/should be part of it, and how it all fits together. No one, I think, ever came up with a notion of DH that had widespread consensus as being a good definition. Now, it seems, we are chasing after responses to a non-existent notion. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That said, I do see the existence of two branches of DH, with different histories. In broad strokes, one is the &#34;Humanities Computing&#34; branch, on is indeed the more web-oriented branch (which shares more in common with ed tech). This has been recounted many times before, sometimes in this very site.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd ask that we all recognize the youth of DH, and this it is -- whatever it is! -- still developing through informal channels like THATCamps and blogs and twitter conversation, and through the institutional decisions made by administrators and through cluster hires. In short, I think it is far too early to say that DH is far too focused on textual disciplines. It might be at present, but the ultimate constitution of DH is still very much to be determined. Awesome visualization and interpretation of data -- textual, architectual, visual, geographical, temporal, archaeological, and more -- through digital/code-based means can and should be part of DH. I consider it to be implicit that it _is_, but maybe hasn't had as much attention as other aspects. Seems parallel to the Theory and DH questions that way?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Is learning to code even important in Digital Humanities?  I argue that it's not.  There are particular technologies that are relevant to various disciplines in the humanities, and web development isn't necessarily one of them (since coding always refers to web development in DH contexts).  Digital Humanities, capital D capital H, is far too focused on the textual disciplines and hardly inclusive of the humanities as a whole.  Digital Humanists ought to reconsider their notion of the Digital Humanities.  If you wonder why computer scientists are reluctant to get involved in Capital D Capital H, it's for this reason.  There are actually a great many computer scientists involved elsewhere in the humanities.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for all the great answers!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To update this forum, two of the respondents (Brian Croxall and Jeff McClurken) along with Ryan Cordell spoke about &#34;Teaching DH 101: Introduction to the Digital Humanities&#34; for NITLE's Digital Scholarship Seminars in December.  You can access the recording from the event website:&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.nitle.org/live/events/129-teaching-dh-101-introduction-to-the-digital&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This seminar prompted a couple of posts on the NITLE blog because the presenters didn't really address coding for undergrads.  Here are a couple of posts that adress that issue:&#60;br /&#62;
Can Humanities Undergrads Learn to Code? by undergrads who learned to code in a humanities course at Pitt &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/01/31/can-humanities-undergrads-learn-to-code/&#60;/a&#62; (The answer is yes!!)&#60;br /&#62;
More Coding for Humanities Undergrads by Kathryn Tomasek, Wheaton College (again yes!!) &#60;a href=&#34;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://blogs.nitle.org/2012/02/02/more-coding-for-humanities-undergrads/&#60;/a&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi Hope,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Another option would be to have your students do close reading using XML, but not necessarily TEI.  This gets them encoding much faster. They can still look at TEI for examples of what people tend to care about encoding, and juxtapose it with their own markup/editorial decisions. Some interesting discussions can flow from that.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I taught text encoding at a &#60;a href=&#34;http://thatcampnewengland.org/&#34;&#62;THATCamp&#60;/a&#62; a few weeks ago. Not much you can do in 75 minutes, but even in that short time workshop attendees had the chance to wrap their minds around the basic concepts and start asking quite sophisticated questions.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Other examples of using idiosyncratic XML for close reading include &#60;a href=&#34;http://golf.services.brown.edu/projects/VHL/&#34;&#62;Virtual Humanities Lab&#60;/a&#62; (see the FAQ, and the Esposizioni and Cronica in particular) and &#60;a href=&#34;http://rolandht.org/&#34;&#62;RolandHT&#60;/a&#62;.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've done this previously but as a method of teaching markup rather than close reading of a text, usually with a short and unproblematic poem in any case.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For example in our TEI Summer School in Oxford in 2010 we used In Flanders Fields for markup practice with exercises on metadata and transcription phenomenon. &#60;a href=&#34;http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Oxford/2010-07-oxford/&#34;&#62;http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Oxford/2010-07-oxford/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I think the approach though, of having students do close reading by teaching them some basic markup and having them markup and discuss the textual problems in the text at hand.  What you end up teaching them is more than close reading, it is editorial theory, perhaps philology, and a bit about metadata which feeds into their knowledge about proper referencing and citation.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Alex Gil and I are working with Jerome McGann to do some TEI markup of a number of different versions of two poems by Emily Dickinson in an undergraduate poetry class this semester. We're writing about process as we go at &#60;a href=&#34;http://tangouva.wordpress.com&#34;&#62;http://tangouva.wordpress.com&#60;/a&#62;. We'll be posting more about this experience (particularly the TEI stuff) in coming weeks.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I wouldn't say that we used &#34;TEI encoding to do a close reading&#34;; our chief interest has been using TEI as a way to capture the complexities of a single poem's textual history and to introduce students to aspects of literary study which undergraduate education rarely covers. I do think, though, that close reading skills are indispensable when using TEI in this way and in using TEI in the classroom more generally. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For our purposes, comparing multiple witnesses to the manuscript and print history of a single poem, we are interested in how apparently minor changes (the presence or absence of line indentation; changes in punctuation and capitalization; changes in a poem's title) can affect what and &#60;em&#62;how&#60;/em&#62; a poem means. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The result is a close reading focused not on semantic or linguistic aspects of the verse (&#34;Why this word?&#34; &#34;What does this repetition suggest?&#34;) but on the various ways in which a &#34;single poem&#34; gets represented, how it enters print, and on its &#60;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=uwNGEc_2FQ8C&#38;amp;lpg=PA57&#38;amp;dq=%22bibliographical%20codes%22%20mcgann&#38;amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&#38;amp;q&#38;amp;f=false&#34;&#62;&#34;bibliographical codes&#34;&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Because the question one faces when moving a poem from paper to TEI is always &#34;What to mark up?&#34; I think this exercise is particularly useful for highlighting the importance of such bibliographical codes. I would be interested, though, in hearing how other folks might use TEI to do a more traditional sort of close reading.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Does anyone have specific examples of assignments that use TEI encoding to do a close reading of a text? The assignment, the results or general comments about how that could be structured, or if it did work with students, would be appreciated.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;As an undergraduate, I approach this with a different perspective albeit slightly skewed due to where I study.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I was first introduced to a digital humanities tool in my basic writing seminar Freshman year, Spring 2007. The primary goal of the course was to create a research paper on an aspect of The Great Gatsby. My prof. recommended the use of Zotero. This requirement opened the gateway of what exactly is possible.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Personally, I feel that Zotero should be a commonly known resource among undergraduate students; however, most that I associate with have no clue about it. As an English major, I hate to say that it may be a downfall of our basic Composition courses. Who does it fall on to teach students in their beginning semester how to research beyond google? AND make the most of this researching time?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With the influx of Blackboard and Angel sites for classes, the opportunity to open student's eyes to digital humanities is much greater. Recommending links to collaborative sites that offer more information than google ever will. Also, offering links to free downloadable tools that students are not aware of.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Most undergrads are coming out of a generation that does not know what it is like to be without a laptop, wireless internet, or a cell phone. A lot of students are very open to the ideas behind digital humanities to an extent where it could easily be incorporated. Quite frankly, a discussion based around social networking, microblogging, et als effects on humanities most likely will engage more students. It may potentially pull them away from facebook chat long enough to pay attention.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This is a terrific thread.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I integrate DH style assignments into several of my classes, but my favorite class in a seminar of juniors and seniors called Adventures in Digital History in which the students actually do some DH of their own.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In this course they are split up into groups, given broad topics, introduced to a &#34;digital toolkit&#34; of open-source tools, and then asked to design and build their own digital history projects.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The course sites can be found (along with links to each students own narrative project blogs and the projects themselves) for &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhistory.umwblogs.org/&#34;&#62;2008&#60;/a&#62; and &#60;a href=&#34;http://dh2010.umwblogs.org/&#34;&#62;2010&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[The question of a DH-undergraduate curriculum came up at the 2010 THATCamp Prime -- the notes from that session are &#60;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AaEG5-WveNQ3ZGR6M3I4a3pfNjVnZ2ptNzRmMw&#38;amp;hl=en&#34;&#62;here&#60;/a&#62;.]

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have never taught a course specifically focused on the digital humanities. But I really enjoy inserting a few DH-lite assignments into my regular courses. The goal is to get students &#60;a href=&#34;http://chnm2010.thatcamp.org/05/21/teaching-students-transferable-skills/&#34;&#62;transferable digital skills&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;With that, I offer my survey classes a chance to build a collaborative timeline. You can find my assignment--which is adapted from one by &#60;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/jbj&#34;&#62;Jason B. Jones&#60;/a&#62; at my blog: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/02/03/assignment-the-american-century-geospatial-timeline/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/02/03/assignment-the-american-century-geospatial-timeline/&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For my course on media theory, I asked them to crowdsource an annotated bibliography of articles on media theory and related to the texts we were reading. That assignment is available at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/01/18/final-annotated-zotero-group-bibliography-assignment/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.briancroxall.net/2010/01/18/final-annotated-zotero-group-bibliography-assignment/&#60;/a&#62;. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks all for sharing your ideas here. It's giving me ideas about what I could do the next time I start teaching.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;In December of 2001, the Wheaton College (Norton, MA) faculty voted to &#34;teach together&#34; in various combinations. This unique alternative to a list of requirements provides an exciting way to explore different areas of knowledge and different approaches to problems. Courses are linked across any two of six academic areas: creative arts, humanities, history, math and computer science, natural sciences, and social sciences. Pairs of connected courses may be taken in either order and do not need to be taken in consecutive semesters, although departmental planning across campus attempts to offer each course of a connection within a year of the other.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#34;Computing for Poets&#34; (COMP 131) is connected with two courses in English: &#34;Anglo-Saxon Literature&#34; and &#34;J.R.R Tolkien&#34;. For example, in the connection with Anglo-Saxon Literature, the relationship between Old English poems has been a vexed question for nearly 150 years. Because students may take the courses in either order, both English and Computer Science faculty participate in syllabus design and make several guest lectures in the other course to help reinforce the connection between the disciplines. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For students majoring in the humanities and taking the computer science course, an exposure to the application of computers to manage the storage and retrieval of written texts shows by example the many new opportunities for scholars of ancient and other written works. In particular, the &#34;Poets&#34; course teaches computer programming as a vehicle to personalize the exploration of vast collections of poems and corpora now available online, including stylometry and authorship attribution. Course work includes a rich exposure to pattern matching with regular expressions, parsing large collections of XML files (e.g., corpora marked up according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) schema), building a concordance, examining the top-N words in your own writing, and elementary statistical methods for authorship attribution. &#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've heard Greg Crane and Chris Blackwell make very good cases for how technology allows undergrads to get involved in serious humanities research. That is, rather than just teaching undergrads *about* the digital humanities, we should also get them to actually *do* it and feel they are making a real contribution.  Greg notes that in the sciences, it is much more common to see undergrads working in labs and actually being productive parts of the research effort. Why not in the digital humanities?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here are articles from both of them on this topic:&#60;/p&#62;
