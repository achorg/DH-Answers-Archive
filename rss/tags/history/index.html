			<description>&#60;p&#62;You may also want to consider using Polinode. At the moment, Polinode lets you not only visualize and analyze network data like Gephi, but also to collect network data via highly-flexible relationship surveys. You are also able to import network data for analysis from an Excel file or in JSON or GEXF format. If you are interested, you can check out a short video at our website (full disclosure: I am the founder):&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I guess this topic was originally posted before I finished my MA. I got my MA in classical archaeology from the University of Virginia in 2013. Instead of a traditional research project, I wrote on the technical underpinnings of the Roman coin projects we are doing at the American Numismatic Society and the application of linked data to the UVA numismatic collection, which was basically the culmination of my academic career up to that point. The digital projects weren't accepted in lieu of a thesis however, and they should not have been. The thesis provided a background of the history of the description of coins from the Renaissance to the database era and beyond, with specific use cases detailing the digital future of the discipline. The thesis was basically the digital state of the field in 2013.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm not sure that a written thesis should be removed altogether. &#60;em&#62;Something&#60;/em&#62; should be written to place the project into context.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;What do you mean by non-canonical? There is a fairly large number of prosopographical projects that are focused on people connected by a common thread, for example:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Syriac (&#60;a href=&#34;http://syriaca.org/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://syriaca.org/&#60;/a&#62;)&#60;br /&#62;
Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.pase.ac.uk/index.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.pase.ac.uk/index.html&#60;/a&#62;)&#60;br /&#62;
Roman Republican people (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2012-07mr.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2012-07mr.html&#60;/a&#62;)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm also vaguely aware of projects to network people related to cuneiform or ancient papyri. All of these projects involve anonymous or otherwise barely-known people who are only attributed by scant fragments of evidence.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Linked data methodologies are fundamental in most or all of these projects.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am looking for examples of digital humanities projects that examine non-canonical figures (individuals or small groups of people). I will use the information as context for a digital humanities project that I am working on.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;You might want to use Social Networks Visualizer from &#60;a href=&#34;http://socnetv.sourceforge.net&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://socnetv.sourceforge.net&#60;/a&#62; It is a open-source, cross-platform graphical application for analysis and visualization of social networks. It allows you to load or create and modify social networks in a canvas, rotate, zoom, change node attributes, analyse their social and mathematical properties and apply visualization layouts for relevant presentation in papers etc. Can create known social datasets automatically as well as random networks and small worlds. Computes basic graph properties, such as density, diameter, geodesics, connectedness, eccentricity, etc. It also calculates advanced measures for social network analysis such as centrality and prestige indices (i.e. closeness centrality, betweeness centrality, information centrality, proximity and rank prestige), triad census, cliques, clustering coefficient, etc.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Cécile Armand has written an analysis (in French) of different online timeline tools.&#60;br /&#62;
&#60;a href=&#34;http://advertisinghistory.hypotheses.org/79&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://advertisinghistory.hypotheses.org/79&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
I have used SIMILE. Dates came from an XML file and could be year only. But the position on the timeline was not where I would have liked. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Has anyone dealt with a large number of events (over 1,000) ? Is there a way to provide &#34;levels of detail&#34; so that the user is not submerged with an overloaded timeline?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks for any suggestions on this.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Perhaps at an angle to what you're describing, from time to time I post on lexicography and literary writing, especially poetry, here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://poetry-contingency.uwaterloo.ca/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://poetry-contingency.uwaterloo.ca/&#60;/a&#62;, with an emphasis on text mining and comparison.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Replying to @&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/profile/milner_matt'&#62;milner_matt&#60;/a&#62;'s &#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/timeline-tools#post-2071&#34;&#62;post&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Just a second vote for Timeline.js, though my main beef is the requirement to have data either hosted externally or in JSON format, a bit of a hurdle for many n00bs. I'm very interested to hear more about your work, @&#60;a href='/DH-Answers-Archive/profile/milner_matt'&#62;milner_matt&#60;/a&#62;, with hooking it up (de facto) to a MySQL db. Are you working on a fork or just on your own? (I couldn't find you in GitHub.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For what it's worth, I'm maintaining my running list of timeline tools at &#60;a href=&#34;http://delicious.com/triplingual/timeline+chronology&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://delicious.com/triplingual/timeline+chronology&#60;/a&#62;, including a link to @croxall's Google Spreadsheet from a while back.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Oddly enough I'm actually building a timeline tool for the Intro to European History I'm teaching this fall. Basically I'm going to crowdsource a European timeline between 400AD-1700AD in the classroom.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've looked a few things - yes, SIMILE is great and the de facto standard. But as an historian the date handling rubs me the wrong way - perhaps I'm reading the code wrong, but it requires a valid JS Date to work. I want more ambiguity and flexibility when it comes to date parts. I also wanted to place the entire timeline within a custom-designed course website rather than try and handle it with moodle, wordpress, drupal, etc. or even WebCT/Blackboard like 'things' (don't know what else to call them). SIMILE is ideal for most of this. That said, I decided to try something else.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Here's a link of some useful jQuery based timelines I looked at: &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2013/06/jquery-timeline-plugins.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2013/06/jquery-timeline-plugins.html&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
I wanted something simple that could handle quite a bit of student-produced data. Timeliner.js at TechnoTarek looked about right, but I was really going for something horizontal and with a nice nav bar like SIMILE - so I went with VeriteCo's TimelineJS &#60;a href=&#34;http://timeline.verite.co/)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://timeline.verite.co/)&#60;/a&#62;. It can handle BC dates as well as AD dates.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are several advantages with this - first is being able to embed a timeline right away using their site and a published googlespreadsheet. The other is the code is pretty straightforward. I'm in the process of adapting it to run off of ajax-generated&#60;br /&#62;
JSON from a MYSQL DB. The only thing is the viewable space for each item - though there's media handling (not using it for other reasons in my course), there's not enough place for a description of the event itself. So I'm using a dialog box to display the full contents, while the timeline itself has a teaser.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The big disadvantage is that TimelineJS uses LazyLoad to create the 'story' - meaning that I'm stuck at the moment with an awkward setTimeout after the ajax / rendering to make further jQuery-based selections. $.ajaxStop() doesn't work because of the small (but significant) space in between the completion of the ajax request and the rendering from JSON into html elements. If anyone has suggestions on how to add a callback (was thinking .always or someting .done / .when-.then - but these are all ajax, and I don't have time to crack the minified js and insert a callback variable...) - without too much trouble, please let me know.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've integrated Timemap (&#60;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/timemap/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://code.google.com/p/timemap/&#60;/a&#62;) into a lot of different projects.  Timemap is a JS library that binds mapping libraries (e.g., OpenLayers or Google Maps) together with Simile timeline.  Simile still seems to be the de facto standard timeline library in DH.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Time for the annual/biannual timeline tools question: any recommendations for timeline tools? Of the many that are out there, including those that have been recommended here before, any movement to coalesce around a stellar handful?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some useful features would be: free online (no need to install on lab computers, or quick easy to install), includes multiple file types, might be three dimensional (or at least a &#34;matrix&#34; type design), can deal with 'circa' type dates.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks, Hope.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Are there any writings on the relationship between lexicography, discourse analysis, and text/data mining?  As I continue work on a keyword-specific project, I'm wondering where the theoretical, historical, and methodological overlaps are in these various ways of mapping epistemology through language.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are tons of questions one can ask between these fields, but I'm thinking in particular about whether something like the peaks and valleys in a frequency analysis constitute the rise and fall of a Foucauldian &#34;discursive regularity.&#34;  I recently saw &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/661645&#34;&#62;Bernard Geoghegan's piece in Critical Inquiry&#60;/a&#62; on enthusiasm for cybernetics research among French structuralists (a history he argues is important to visit in light of today's digital revolutions in the humanities), but it raises more questions than answers, wonderful as they are.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any leads would be much appreciated!

&#60;p&#62;If you are a student and need SNA software for your coursework, you can get NetMiner 4 coursework license for free for 6 months. It features statstics and visualization as well as SNA. And it's very easy to use. I think it is valuable to try. :-)&#60;/p&#62;
