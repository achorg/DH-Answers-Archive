			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;br /&#62;
I'm putting together assignments for next semester's digital history class, and want to construct a simple distant reading for my students, probably using Voyant Tools (unless there is a very easy-to-use pure HTML/Javascript set of tools that will let my students use some of the basic JS skills they'll have acquired in their previous assignment).  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I would like to present them with existing corpora of historical texts: preferably not literature, but newspapers/government documents, letters etc. Most archives I've found use PDF images with mediocre to poor OCR.  Can anyone point me to a good collection of historical corpora that students can experiment with?  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thank you!
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am developing a data set that charts the relationships between rabbis in antiquity.  I am now keeping this data in tabular form (rabbi x/term of relationship/rabbi y).  Could anyone recommend a software package - preferably open source and not too difficult to use - that can help me visualize and analyze this data?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi all!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I’m looking for examples of humanities or history departments that allow students to produce digital products for MA thesis and/or PhD dissertation credit. Better yet, I’d like to find language from departmental operating papers or catalogs about accepting digital work for graduate credit.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My history department at a regional masters comprehensive university is considering allowing students to produce digital products for the MA in lieu of the traditional history thesis. If possible, I’d like to draw on examples from other departments that are already doing this rather than inventing the procedures from scratch. Any ideas or recommendations?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For all you grad students out there, I’d like to mention that this idea came from several students doing innovative projects. If you believe in innovative digital scholarship, keep pushing for it!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Jeff Manuel

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am looking for examples of digital humanities projects that examine non-canonical figures (individuals or small groups of people). I will use the information as context for a digital humanities project that I am working on.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Time for the annual/biannual timeline tools question: any recommendations for timeline tools? Of the many that are out there, including those that have been recommended here before, any movement to coalesce around a stellar handful?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Some useful features would be: free online (no need to install on lab computers, or quick easy to install), includes multiple file types, might be three dimensional (or at least a &#34;matrix&#34; type design), can deal with 'circa' type dates.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks, Hope.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Are there any writings on the relationship between lexicography, discourse analysis, and text/data mining?  As I continue work on a keyword-specific project, I'm wondering where the theoretical, historical, and methodological overlaps are in these various ways of mapping epistemology through language.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There are tons of questions one can ask between these fields, but I'm thinking in particular about whether something like the peaks and valleys in a frequency analysis constitute the rise and fall of a Foucauldian &#34;discursive regularity.&#34;  I recently saw &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/661645&#34;&#62;Bernard Geoghegan's piece in Critical Inquiry&#60;/a&#62; on enthusiasm for cybernetics research among French structuralists (a history he argues is important to visit in light of today's digital revolutions in the humanities), but it raises more questions than answers, wonderful as they are.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Any leads would be much appreciated!

Although some say that I am the pioneer of the computers in the humanities, such a title needs a good deal of nuancing... [O]n the stacks of the IBM library in New York City I had spotted a book (whose title I have forgotten), which was printed some time between 1920 and 1940: in it someone mentioned that it was possible to make lists of names by means of punched cards.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Has anybody figured out what book he may have had in mind?&#60;/p&#62;

				<title>Shane Landrum on "Best practices for historical-primary-source translations sites?"</title>
						<link>http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/best-practices-for-historical-primary-source-translations-sites#post-1073</link>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;A colleague (currently in doctoral coursework in history) is working on translating historical primary sources about mid-20th-century North African anti-colonial revolutions. These are currently available only in French-language anthologies and are hard to get by interlibrary loan, but she's gotten copies and wants to translate them into English (and eventually into Arabic). I've suggested that she consider putting her translations online for pedagogical purposes.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Before I get myself in too deep on this, I'd love some guidance by people who know more about translations websites. (Once I've seen enough answers here, I'll probably just forward the URL of this discussion to her, and she can ask her own clarifying questions.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ul&#62;
&#60;li&#62; I'm aware of at least one existing site, &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/europe/integrated_history/about.asp&#34;&#62;Integrated History&#60;/a&#62;, that does precisely this-- English translations of Eastern European history sources-- but I'd welcome examples of others that present scholarly translations well, particularly for historical texts. (For this purpose, it's a plus if they're small-scale/solo-scholar/DIY in nature.)&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;What are the intellectual-property/rights issues of translating portions of published texts from a published anthology, when the original sources being anthologized are &#34;historical&#34; in nature (i.e. not &#34;literary&#34; and thus subject to litigation from an author's estate)? The jurisdiction of first publication is France (or maybe Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco-- unsure on this), within the last 50 years. How copyright-risky would it be for her to put the French text online alongside her English and/or Arabic translations?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Is the &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/europe/integrated_history/copyright.asp&#34;&#62;Integrated History copyright statement&#60;/a&#62; a reasonable model for a copyright disclaimer? I like my sources website's &#60;a href=&#34;http://cliotropic.org/sources/copyright/&#34;&#62;copyright statement&#60;/a&#62;, but it wouldn't be a good model in this case, since all my online sources are copyright-expired and/or US government documents.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;I know that &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/&#34;&#62;TEI&#60;/a&#62; is the Real Scholars' Tool for encoding translations, but it's got a high learning curve and (from what I can see) mostly makes sense for larger-scale projects with a literary flavor, not small, short-term proof-of-concept projects. (I'd be open to hearing good arguments to the contrary, though.) If one were encoding one's translations in a future-compatible way, what's the minimal set of formatting tags that overlap between HTML and TEI?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Since my colleague doesn't yet have a webserver setup of her own, I was going to suggest &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.net&#34;&#62;Omeka.Net&#60;/a&#62; as a way to get started quickly and without much technical overhead, with the thought that if she wants to expand or install custom plugins like &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/TeiDisplay&#34;&#62;TeiDisplay&#60;/a&#62; later, she can buy a webhosting plan then. Is there any reason I should be suggesting a tool other than Omeka for this project?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;Scholars' Lab folks: How mature is the TeiDisplay plugin? Where can I see it running?&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ul&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks in advance for your suggestions and comments.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've been asked to help someone find sources on the history of markup and the proliferation of markup languages. I can think of a few seminal texts to throw at them (&#34;What Is Text, Really?&#34; or Maler and el Andaloussi), but I don't know of any, er, metatexts of this nature.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Does anyone else?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I've often found myself wondering if anybody has written a book-length narrative history telling the story of humanities computing/digital humanities from the early days of humanities computing until now (or some approximation thereof), addressing major milestone DH projects, related efforts, and some of the big themes of the field as they've evolved--or haven't--over time?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I suspect that some histories may have been done that address particular disciplines (e.g. digital history), but have they been tied together and examined as a whole?  I see that the question has been addressed in conference presentations, such as those by &#60;a href=&#34;http://infomotions.com/blog/tag/digital-humanities/&#34;&#62;Joe Raben&#60;/a&#62; or &#60;a href=&#34;http://infomotions.com/blog/2010/05/cyberinfrastructure-days-at-the-university-of-notre-dame/&#34;&#62;Stéfan Sinclair&#60;/a&#62;, and appears in Chapter 1 of Schreibman et al.'s &#34;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/&#34;&#62;A Companion to Digital Humanities&#60;/a&#62;,&#34; but I wondered if anything longer has been published.  I may well have just sailed right past it.  Seems like it would make a great oral history project, too.
