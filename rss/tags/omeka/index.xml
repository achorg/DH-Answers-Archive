&#60;p&#62;Responded on Twitter, but for the archive of the question here: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We used Dublin Core fields behind Omeka to catalog individual hardware components from some of MITH's vintage computers: &#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;This reflects strength and weakness of both DC and Omeka itself. What an &#34;Item&#34; is is left completely up to you and your interpretation. That chains down to how to interpret the DC fields depending a bit on how you define an &#34;Item&#34;.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In your case, it might be helpful to create item types. One could be &#34;Particular Component&#34; (i.e., yours) and one could be &#34;Component Type&#34; for the general class.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'd probably call Synertek the creator, and probably make &#34;Fabrication Place&#34; as item type metadata.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I've got my students working on an assignment where we take apart old media devices, learn about their key components, and then create an Omeka exhibit about our device, using Neatline to trace each component in time and space. This part works pretty well, so far.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;For example, I'm taking apart an Atari VCS. The MOS 6507 CPU bears the MOS technologies logo so was probably (I've learned) manufactured at their plant in Norristown, PA. The TIA chip, on the other hand, has a Synertek logo which (I've learned) second-sourced many of the integrated circuits used by Atari. Even though Atari's TIA chip (the famous Stella) was originally fabricated by MOS in Pennsylvania, &#60;em&#62;mine&#60;/em&#62; was produce at Synertek in California. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;My problem is, I want to capture that kind of distinction in my record, but I'm not sure how to use Omeka's Dublin Core fields to describe everything that I find interesting about these chips, including those differences in production sites. My understanding of DC is pretty basic -- for example, does it make a distinction between &#34;The TIA Chip&#34; as a class of objects exhibiting uniform properties, vs. &#34;My TIA Chip&#34; which has a specific origin in time and place? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In other words, is Synertek the &#34;creator&#34;, &#34;publisher&#34;, or &#34;source&#34;? And what does &#34;coverage&#34; mean?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Am I over-thinking this? Are there better ontologies for this kind of archive?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I welcome any and all suggestions. Thanks for your time.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Zach

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Using Omeka for discovery of bibliographic collections was discussed in a related post by Susan Hollis Merritt (&#60;a href=&#34;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/most-effective-software-for-building-searchable-digital-bibliographic-database#post-1856)&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/most-effective-software-for-building-searchable-digital-bibliographic-database#post-1856)&#60;/a&#62;.  I'd like to focus on the public display aspect touched upon therein.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A few of us here at Indiana University are exploring options for fostering image-based bibliographic collections.  Most of these to date are driven by scholars so they serve very specific research questions, but our Rare Books library could very well benefit from such a platform for documents with broader appeal.  Poking around the Omeka forums and the interwebs, I noticed a lot of interest in the Zotero plugin for Omeka, but I am curious to see some examples of Zotero-based collections using Omeka as an end-user delivery system.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Please share links and any other pertinent info!   I am especially curious how well importing file attachments work. Thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I run a lot of different Omeka instances and have to do all kinds of crazy deployments and maintenance. I packaged these all up in to a library that you can install (depends on Ruby) called &#60;a href=&#34;https://rubygems.org/gems/omeka-recipes&#34;&#62;omeka-recipes&#60;/a&#62;. You can set up pretty complex server configurations (e.g. staging, production, development) and move databases around with the database tasks. It also has the ability to sync assets (images, etc.), as well as help manage deployments. It may be way overkill for your needs, but for me, it's what I use to manage all of my Omeka instances.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Basic usage:&#60;/p&#62;


&#60;div class=&#34;bb_syntax&#34;&#62;&#60;div class=&#34;code&#34;&#62;&#60;pre class=&#34;ruby&#34; style=&#34;font-family:monospace;&#34;&#62;cap db:mysql:dump
cap db:mysql:fetch_dump
cap omeka:sync_assets&#60;/pre&#62;&#60;/div&#62;&#60;/div&#62;



&#60;p&#62;The first command will log on to your sever and generate a backup file for you (reading the db.ini file). The second will download the file to your local machine and the third will download everything in your archive directory to your local computer.
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Good advice above. I'll add, though, that if you can back up the archives directory from the Omeka installation itself, it will be very valuable if you ever need it (hopefully not!).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That's because the database dump stores the connection between files and items via its own generated filename -- not what you have in the identifier field. That is, without having the files as Omeka recognizes them in the archives directory, you would risk losing the connection between item, metadata, and file, and would still end up having to recreate the connections. Trust me, this has the potential to make you cry!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;So, if you use the script Lincoln linked to, modifying it to make sure you grab a copy of the archives directory as well (or the whole kit and kaboodle of your installation) will be very helpful.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Good luck
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;The script Lincoln linked to looks very good.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;mysqldump is exactly the command you want for this kind of backup.  It will create a file that contains everything you need to completely restore a MySQL database (the database schema and all your data).  For future reference, it is also possible to have mysqldump return just the data or just the schema.  On the command line type &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;mysqldump --help &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;to see all your options.  (If you've installed MySQL using MacPorts then the command is mysqldump5).
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Thanks for the help. The shell script strategy was the way I was going to go, as I had already figured out how to do mysqldump. Not knowing anything about MySQL, I wanted some confirmation that this backup file &#60;em&#62;really would&#60;/em&#62; contain everything I would need to restore the whole project. I'll also check out the script Lincoln recommends.

&#60;p&#62;Caleb,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;You might take a look at &#60;a href=&#34;http://theme.fm/2011/06/a-shell-script-for-a-complete-wordpress-backup-4/&#34;&#62;this post that describes a shell script&#60;/a&#62; for automatically backing up WordPress. Since WordPress and Omeka run on the same stack, the script is probably pretty close to what you need.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I haven't spent much time in Omeka, but you could write a pretty simple shell script to manage this.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The first thing you should do is use mysqldump to output the database to a SQL export. Then either rsync of git push it to the local machine. After you get these mashed together into a script, add that to the /etc/crontab to schedule it.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;That's an off the top of my head strategy, let me know if you want further detail and I'll try to make time to get you something to work with.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have no experience at all with PHP or MySQL, but I have recently put an Omeka installation on a server I have running on a virtual machine, where I have root privileges. If at all possible, I would like to be able to automatically back up my database to my local Unix-based machine at regular intervals, perhaps using something like Git or scp.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I don't necessarily have to backup all of the Omeka item files, as I have a folder on my local machine that contains all my PDFs and images in the Omeka database, with filenames that are identical to the &#34;Identifier&#34; field in my Omeka items. But I do want to get all of the metadata backed up, even just by grabbing the XML output. But I do want to be able to do this without having to think about it often or log in to Omeka to do the backup. Is there a way to do this?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello Carin,&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;At the ENS de Lyon (&#60;a href=&#34;http://ens-lyon.fr/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://ens-lyon.fr/&#60;/a&#62;) we are using Omeka to display a few corpora. We fixed some issues in the current TeiDisplay plugin :&#60;br /&#62;
- fixed bugs in populating and depopulating the TeiConfig table (when deleting a file, re-installing the plugin...)&#60;br /&#62;
- removed TEI.2 handling and added teiCorpus handling instead&#60;br /&#62;
- the plugin now checks whether a XML file is a TEI or teiCorpus file&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you and your colleague are interested we will be pleased to send it to you and discuss it with you.&#60;br /&#62;
Best regards,&#60;br /&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Want to add an update to Patrick's update from six months ago, the procedures for exporting item data from an Omeka.net site for import into a self-hosted Omeka site can be found here: &#60;a href=&#34;http://info.omeka.net/manage-an-account/expiration-and-renewal/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://info.omeka.net/manage-an-account/expiration-and-renewal/&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Also want to emphasize that this export provides you with a CSV file that contains item metadata and links to your files for importing into another Omeka site. Exhibits and pages have to be replicated by hand, there is no export of any plugin-related data.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm very happy to see all the good ideas finally emerge in this thread. I feared that it wouldn't get off the ground at first when it went an unusually long time without a response!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The one-size-fits all problem is one that I often encounter when working with TEI texts. As was mentioned, a really versatile plugin that could handle the myriad possibilities within TEI would call for a huge amount of code. So breaking things apart could lead to some interesting growable hacks. Here's a couple thoughts. . . &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;One thing that I'm seeing in the thread is that a lot of what's desired isn't really a TEI Display plugin. It sounds more like a TEI Processing plugin. Breaking it apart this way could help rethink what needs to be done, and avoid the trap I see so often of TEI on the web being just about pushing it through XSLT to display the HTML.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;And so, TEIProcessing might handle the uploading of a TEI doc, and be built up around doing some of the processing of elements. This might work similarly to the &#60;a href=&#34;http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/csv-import/&#34;&#62;CSVImport plugin&#60;/a&#62;, which lets you map columns of CSV into Dublin Core or other elements. Here, instead of mapping columns, you'd be mapping the TEI elements. Starting with CSVImport as a model might get that code off the ground very quickly. I don't know if it would be better to scan all the available elements the way CSVImport scan columns, or have a more complex configuration specific to each text. I see the possibility that the combination of elements and attributes available in a TEI text could lead to some complex logic to the mappings. The nice thing about that approach is that it would at least get some of the data into the fields that are indexed and searchable in Omeka.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A TEIDisplay plugin, on the other hand, might handle things like uploading different XSLT, and assigning which XSLT to use on which TEI documents already in Omeka. For that matter, it might even want to work with other ways to produce the display, kinda like how Anthologize starts with a (mostly kinda-sorta) TEI document to produce different output formats through various techniques, not just XSLT.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Things like that, that handle the very basic interactions with Omeka, would then make it easier for other plugins to be built up that take advantage of that in ways more unique to a particular project or set of TEI texts.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Just some thoughts --- good luck! This sounds exciting!
