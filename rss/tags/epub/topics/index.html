			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'm interested in creating downloadable ebooks that include video and other multimedia elements. As I understand it -- and I'm new to this, so please correct me -- publications like Wired use Adobe InDesign to create these multimedia elements.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Are there alternatives to InDesign that are cheaper or less locked down? What would you use if you were going to do something like this?
&#60;/p&#62;</description>

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone,&#60;br /&#62;
I am a visual anthropologist and want to know if you can advise me which way is better for me to publish one of my research projects electronically.&#60;br /&#62;
My work is about material culture and their technics of production. Therefore in my book I will have texts, photos, maps, sounds, films and because of the nature of my research I need to create links between all of this. But please don’t forget my target are mostly social scientists: anthropologists, archaeologists, sociologists,…&#60;br /&#62;
So can you kindly let me know what is your feedback? Shall I use one of the ready programs which we can find on the net or I should find someone to write such program for my publication project.&#60;br /&#62;
Thanks in advance for your kind supports.&#60;br /&#62;
