			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi,&#60;br /&#62;
We are frequently overwhelmed with digital information. We do not switch off our smart phones and devices till late in the night this disturbs our sleep and on top of it, there is enough distraction at work during the day. How do we deal with this ?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have personally seen many people on social networks having an emotional breakdown and have gone into depression either due the over-exposure or their ideas and posts not being paid attention to.  They are unable to deal with this exposure and overload of information. As a society, are we going too fast on the information super lane? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;We are not paying enough attention. Human attention span on any piece of useful information is only about 3-4 minutes and beyond this is distraction. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;How do we practice being selective and where do we draw the line ? are the other things that come to my mind right now.  &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you have thoughts or comments please do share. Would greatly appreciate. Cheers, Ramkumar

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I am looking for more examples to explain the 'small world' network phenomenon.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am working on an article on the same. An example which I have taken up is - a modern well connected cluster of villages. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Smart and digitally enabled cluster of villages with urban and social infrastructure are the way forward. In such clusters, every body is connected to everybody. Information passes through all them seamlessly. Everybody stays informed and there are numerous advantages from eliminating village feuds to sharing farm practices and social welfare schemes. Similarly, there could be others. Cheers, Ramkumar

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Do you have classroom activities, exercises, and lesson plans about typography (font selection, typesetting, etc.)? I have used one activity for years -- it involves taking a serious or playful text and typesetting it (in InDesign) to look the opposite (for example, making a &#60;em&#62;People Magazine&#60;/em&#62; or &#60;em&#62;Buzzfeed&#60;/em&#62; article look like an article in &#60;em&#62;Harper's Bazaar&#60;/em&#62; or &#60;em&#62;The New York Times&#60;/em&#62;). I think this idea came from Johanna Drucker but I cannot find the source right now! Some takeaways from the activity are that typographic styles are rhetorical and even small changes make a big difference. At any rate, I would love more ideas for how to teach typography in any college setting / course.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I would like to capture tweets from last year which centered on a particular social movement in Kenya. Many of them were sent or retweeted by @ConsumersKenya, so simply getting an archive of their tweets within a certain timeframe would be quite helpful. Being able to get those who used relevant hashtags during that period would also be fruitful.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;There seem to be plenty of services to archive ongoing tweets, but is there a good way to get historical tweets for certain dates?

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I'd like to use the available corpora in the German Text Archive (&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/download&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/download&#60;/a&#62;) to train OCR software. For this I need these texts as plaintext. All the German Text Archive texts however are all TEI P5 tagged. How do I best convert these (hundreds..) of documents into plaintext? &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm comfortable on the command line and with small shell scripts but I wouldn't be able to write an app to make use of a public API to such a service. Ideally I'd like to find some tei2text-ish command line tool but the ones I've found in googling around and looking on GitHub don't appear (to me, leastways) to be suitable for TEI texts.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi everyone: I have a former grad student who wrote to me in a panic. Apparently, her current department chair has decided that her previous coursework in DH, book history will not count towards her current graduate program, because it does not &#34;correlate&#34; to literature, composition, or teaching. (Wow. I can barely even.) The chair is apparently reacting to an accreditation review and has asked for justification in language accessible to non-specialist peers. Does anyone have go-to resources for helping us make this case? Thank you --

			<description>&#60;p&#62;I have the chance to get a 3D scanner alongside a 3D printer for a DH-lab-to-be, and although there's lots of useful posts here about 3D printers, there doesn't seem to be much about 3D scanners. If anyone has any recommendations or tips, I'd be glad to hear them. It's not going to be state-of-the-art stuff (yet), but there's a lot of scope for interesting work with colleagues at my institution working on digital cultural heritage so I'd like to get something that will at least provide the opportunity for people to pilot ideas or create a proof of concept.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;[Stéfan Sinclair (via DH Commons mentorship program) suggested that I post here.  I have described this project in my &#34;collaborator&#34; or user profile on DH Commons at &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dhcommons.org&#60;/a&#62; ; direct link from the &#34;Collaborators&#34; section at &#60;a href=&#34;http://dhcommons.org/users/susan-hollis-merritt&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://dhcommons.org/users/susan-hollis-merritt&#60;/a&#62; and in my member profile on MLA Commons at &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.mla.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://commons.mla.org&#60;/a&#62; ; direct member link at &#60;a href=&#34;http://commons.mla.org/members/shmerritt/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://commons.mla.org/members/shmerritt/&#60;/a&#62;; direct links are also provided in the Pinter Bibliography and CV sections on my website at &#60;a href=&#34;http://www.susanhollismerritt.org&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://www.susanhollismerritt.org&#60;/a&#62; , where there are related details.]&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am requesting advice and guidance as I explore the possibility of building a searchable digital database for my &#34;Harold Pinter Bibliography&#34; published in print in volumes of &#60;em&#62;The Pinter Review&#60;/em&#62; (Tampa: The University of Tampa Press, 1987-2011).  Each annual/biennial/special edition of this bibliography is published in MLA format (whatever the most current MLA format has been at the time).  I would plan to continue with MLA format for consistency of documentation style throughout.  (I understand that users of such a bibliography could convert easily to whatever format is desired on their end later.)&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I have word-processed files (WordPerfect) for all of the 14 editions of this bibliography.  The same typist working for The University of Tampa Press prepared my word-processed files into a format to be used by the printer.  For several years, she converted my &#34;Harold Pinter Bibliography&#34; files initially to MS Word document files or various versions of PDF files for the printer.  More recently, I gave her my own PDF file versions of my WordPerfect files, which I believe she also converted to Word or to another format for the printer.  The typist's and printer's digital files may be accessible if I need to have them for easier digital conversion.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;A problem with the typist's conversions from one word-processing software program to another has been the loss of accents, punctuation, and other typesetting features, which at times have had to be corrected in printer's proofs.  I have maintained hard copies (original books and parts of books, offprints, photocopies, or print outs) and handwritten index cards (for every entry) to check as back ups of the bibliographic entries in the printed bibliographies for purposes of such error-correction of occasional printer's errors that were missed even in corrected proof.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;From looking into this matter over a decade ago (when ProCite was initially popular), I believe that the printed information (even though digitized) would need to be converted into records featuring bibliographic fields (including annotations, sometimes lengthy, most often very brief) for each printed entry, and each entry would need to have key words and/or phrases (e.g., to accommodate multiple authors, editors, titles, subjects, etc.) so that it could be capable of classification by key words for searching by users.  Also, there are categories and subsections of categories in each published edition of this bibliography that may need some kind of &#34;field&#34;/key word/phrase identification for sorting electronically.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am not familiar with mark up language beyond HTML, but it is possible that I might be able to learn about additional mark up languages if needed (e.g., RIS Format, SML format, etc.).  When I asked this question of a presenter after a DH session at the MLA Convention in Boston, she advised me to look at Drupal (which I have done somewhat), but I am not trained in using it for anything.  It appears to me to be involved in the stage of actually putting an already developed database online.  Another piece of advice I have received is possibly to create an EXCEL type spreadsheet which could be searched.  But before I would begin doing any of this work, I would like to have a plan to use one mode of conversion (one kind of software, so as to avoid duplication of effort).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thus, a main question that I am asking is: What would be the most effective current software package or packages to use for this entire process?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Prior to deciding this project's feasibility and how and where this database would be hosted (institutional partners/support), I need to explore such matters as: (1) the technical requirements for such conversion from printed material to searchable digital format; (2) the estimated cost of such conversion (including the costs of any commercial software packages involved (if any) and of assistance with the physical input of the records); (3) whether or not applying for grant support is warranted; and so on.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I welcome suggestions, advice, and guidance.  Thank you very much.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;[(updated on January 17, 2013)Since first posting this, I have been exploring some earlier DH Q&#38;amp;A threads and found Bethany Nowviskie's suggesting that updates are in progress for &#60;a href=&#34;http://arts-humanities.net/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&#62;http://arts-humanities.net/&#60;/a&#62;, and I will be exploring the &#34;tools&#34; forum there; the &#34;bibliography&#34; section returned an error message when I tried it, so I'll try it again later.]&#60;/p&#62;

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hi!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I'm interested in learning more about computer-based textual analysis, so I developed a project using the journal Literature/Film Quarterly (LFQ). I haven't done this sort of research before, so I'm trying to determine the best questions to ask and the tools that will help me answer them. I'm hoping someone might be able to tell me if these are reasonable questions to ask. I'd also appreciate any suggestions. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;LFQ began in 1973 and continues now. As the oldest journal in the field, looking at the text should be able to provide some insights about how adaptation studies developed.  At about 50 articles a year for 43 years, I'm looking at 2150 articles.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Questions: &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Can an examination of the entire text of LFQ reveal anything substantial about the way adaptation studies has changed from 1973-present?&#60;br /&#62;
What are the most frequently cited texts in each year? WebofScience doesn't support this journal.&#60;br /&#62;
What names (other scholars) appear most frequently each year?&#60;br /&#62;
What kinds of terms are used in earlier years (e.g. “fidelity,” &#34;intertextuality&#34;) and do they continue throughout the journal’s history?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If there are other questions that I could explore, I'd appreciate any suggestions.

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Hello!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I am helping to develop teaching modules around a collection of digitized texts and artefacts, so that non-expert instructors and teachers can integrate these texts into their courses. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Can anyone think of examples of strong teaching modules/guides/plans that are freely available online?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Thanks!

			<description>&#60;p&#62;Has anyone ever created a directory or map of Digital Humanists? I ask because there are so many doing DH in California but I don't know where or how to find them. I follow lists on Twitter, keep updated on recent scholarship and writings, talk to many people, but still I hear about California DH events after the fact. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Would really like to know if someone has taken this up based on the directory from DHNow or DHCommons or Day of DH. &#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I bet if we knew there was someone down the street that we could get up to some interesting shenanigans in DH
