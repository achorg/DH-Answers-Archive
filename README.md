# DH Q&A Website Archive
Snapshot version of the DH Q&amp;A website as of March 24 2019, acquired via `gem install wayback-machine-downloader` in early 2020. The DH Q&A website was inaccessible for much of 2019, so I (@amandavisconti) pulled the last Internet Archive copy of the site down as static files and stored them here. If I’m remembering correctly, DH Q&A new questions were auto-cross-posting to the DH Slack, and I don’t remember any questions coming in on that Slack channel during 2019 through now, so this archive should not be missing any new questions posted after the snapshot but before the site went down (it is possible that folks wrote new answers or edits to existing questions post-3/24/2019 and before the site went offline, and those answers/edits are now lost). 

Note that a related repo under the ACH GitHub org, previously named `DH-Answers`, was renamed as `DH-Answers-BBpress` on 2/19/2020. That repo appears to contain only a 2011 version of the BBpress CMS files for the DH Q&A website, without the associated content/database.
