# DH Q&A Website Archive

This is an archived version of the DH Q&amp;A website based on Wayback Machine
snapshots from February and March 2019.

The site was active from 2010 to early 2019.

Based on DH Q&A questions auto-posting to DH Slack and the
[DH Q&A Twitter account](https://twitter.com/DHAnswers), we believe this snapshot
is not missing any questions between March 2019 and when the site went offline,
but it may be missing new answers or edits.

## Details

Snapshots were downloaded using the [Wayback Machine downloader](https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader) in early 2020 by Amanda Visconti and Rebecca Sutton Koeser.

Since the display of the site was already partially broken by March 2019, the archive site is based primarily on a February 2019 snapshot with missing content added from the March
snapshot. The downloaded snapshot has been edited to create an archive site, including:
- making absolute URLs pointing to the old site relative
- correcting broken javascript and css links
- adjusting RSS links and filenames so the snapshot content renders as XML
- a custom 404 page based on the original
- CSS to add a corner banner indicating the site is an archive
- CSS to disable dynamic links and forms (login links, language switcher)

The two snapshot are available in the repository via tags.

Note that there is a related repository [DH-Answers-BBpress](https://github.com/achorg/DH-Answers-BBpress) (previously named `DH-Answers`). That repository contains the 2011 version of the BBpress files for the DH Q&A website, but does not include any of the site content.
