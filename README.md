# DH-Answers-Archive
Snapshot version of the DH Q&amp;A website acquired via `gem install wayback-machine-downloader` in early 2020. The DH Q&A website was inaccessible for much of 2019, so Amanda Visconti pulled the last Internet Archive copy of the site down as static files and stored them here.

Note that a related repo under the ACH GitHub org, previously named `DH-Answers`, was renamed as `DH-Answers-BBpress` on 2/19/2020. That repo appears to contain only a 2011 version of the BBpress CMS files for the DH Q&A website, without the associated content/database.
