				<div class="post"><p>We have this insane opportunity to design a space for our new DH program, in a beautiful, light-filled area of the library. We've got pros involved, and of course we're getting advice from everyone concerned, but I'd love to hear your "musts" for an inspiring, collaborative research environment. Here are some parameters:</p>
<p>• It will provide drop-in consulting as well as more in-depth project workspace and space for full-time research staff (these spaces don't necessarily need to be separated).</p>
<p>• It's very important for visitors (primarily graduate students and faculty members) to feel welcome.</p>
<p>• One of the primary goals of this space is to encourage collaboration, particularly among people in different disciplines.</p>
<p>In your experience, what are must-haves? What are must-not-haves? </p>
<p>For example, in my mind, an obvious must-have is a whiteboard. Obvious must-not-haves are rigidly divided study carrels. So what else?</p>
<p>And thank you!

				<div class="post"><p>Whiteboards!  Lots of Whiteboards!  Though, it is absolutely vital that they be cleaned properly (when you are done with it).  There is nothing worse than a crappy looking whiteboard.  Be sure to get the proper whiteboard cleaning supplies. In many ways, leaving cool stuff up on the whiteboard (the results of wicked collaborative sessions) will be part of your branding....but it sucks having dirty whiteboards after you are done (will make your space look tired, threadbare, and somewhat worn out).</p>
<p>Tables that can be moved around and reconfigured...and chairs with wheels.</p>
<p>water cooler or fridge that is regularly stocked with drinks</p>
<p>Nice projector (HD if possible) &amp; a nice screen that runs off a local (discreetly located) machine...but which also has a VGA cable that people can easily hook their laptops up to in order to project.</p>
<p>Lots of outlets - especially in the collaborative workspace.  The in the floor, hub outlets are really good.  There is nothing worse than people having to scramble to plug into wall outlets or you having to run extension cables in order to provide enough power for visitor laptops.

				<div class="post"><p>To add to Ethan's suggestions: either a strong and reliable wireless signal, or a bunch of live wired connections (with cables already there for folks to hook up to).</p>
<p>For that VGA cable, a full complement of adapters (mini-VGA, mini-DVI, miniDisplayPort, HDMI).  I'd also add a few fairly large monitors, again with hook-ins, so that multiple groups can each work on their own thing.

				<div class="post"><p>I'm supposed to be helping Miriam with this IRL, but I'll go ahead and say here that there needs to be comfortable seating as well as movable furniture. We want to create a space that is welcoming and that allows people to be excited to be there and do their work.</p>
<p>There also needs to be space where conferences can take place and not disturb others who are working in the space. A fishbowl conference room might be nice, but it could be hard to project in their if too much light gets in. Something like what they have in Cox Hall's computer lab would be worth considering.

				<div class="post"><p>+1 on reconfigurable tables. I'd extend that to any and all furniture (with the possible exception of a couch if space allows.</p>
<p>Possibly instead of a projector, a big flatscreen TV can work well, if budget allows. If it can have it's own computer plugged into it, awesome. If you also have a KVM switch so a laptop can be plugged in, all the better.</p>
<p>I'd also say that to establish that feel, practicing what you preach is always helpful. That is, if everyone who works there is in an open collaborative environment (no cubicles, maybe one private meeting room for when needed), that establishes to everyone the principle of collaboration when they walk in. (It grates me when I see groups espouse collaboration, but their workspaces say the opposite.)

				<div class="post"><p>Wow! I love the idea of a completely open workspace. </p>
<p>I assume all computing will be done on laptops, both student and staff? If that is the case, some kind of charging station will be needed - and if you're not backing up over a network, you may want to integrate a charging station with some kind of backup solution. Depending on where the program is located, you may also need to lock things up. You'll also need some locked space for staff and students to keep personal things, if they don't have any assigned space. </p>
<p>Whiteboards are awesome. We have a rolling whiteboard that is about 4' x 6' - a bunch of those would be great for separating off space when needed. </p>
<p>Extra monitors are essential. We have a lot of work that is really hard to do on one screen (transcribing, CSS work, etc, etc.) I would *love* a bunch of these: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236047" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236047</a> - large monitor with a high resolution. A large monitor can double as a display for small meetings (3-4 people). And a flat screen TV, as Patrick suggests, can also double as an extra monitor in a pinch. Also useful would be a bunch of bigish keydrives and external hard drives that anyone can check out.</p>
<p>I will say that there is a downside to a completely open space - sometimes it can be nice to have a bit of privacy, esp. when one has to crank out a lot of code or do some deep thinking. In a library, this could mean encouraging people to go off to a library study corral if they are finding concentration difficult. If there's enough space, you could also have a couple of quiet work areas. </p>
<p>A shelf full of current tech books. I find it very helpful to be able to hand a student a good book on a topic to help them get up to speed. Depending on the libraries' tech collection, you may be able to forgo this, but at least keep a list of what's available. If you do maintain your own collection, make sure the books are current. Also, you may be able to have books that are part of the library collection, but shelved in your area. It could be a way of getting people in the door (you can decide if that'd be a good or bad thing).</p>
<p>I'll probably think of more things later....

<p>It might be nice to have SmartBoards on either end of the room so there can be multiple projects. If there's a dedicated server for the room, TideBreak's ClassSpot is incredible for collaboration. Users all log in and can take over the SmartBoards and/or projected screen. This means they can share from their laptops links or their entire desktop.  This is often students' favorite tool in our fancy classroom space.

<p>I agree on the suggestion to have at least some quiet spaces,  particularly for times when people want to shut themselves away quietly to get some coding done.  IMO, this is best done by having offices with doors-- perhaps the offices could be reserved by the hour for  particular projects.  (Doors are also important for any of your users who may be using dictation software as an input device.)</p>
<p> I like the suggestion for a shelf of technical books as well. Sometimes it's just easier to look things up in a physical book, particularly in pair–programming or mentoring situations.</p>
<p><em>ETA, several days later:</em> I've just been reminded of why I think this works: a department I work in has an office suite, rather than a set of separate offices facing a common hallway. The suite's common space in this case is used for the department admin, but I think the model might be equally workable for a DH lab/commons/drop-in hackerspace. What's nice about the office suite I'm describing is that department members run into one another nearly automatically in the course of our duties; I think that's particularly desirable for a collaboration-oriented field like DH.

<p> Someone above said that many visitors to this space will probably be using laptops. I'd argue that in that case,  there need to be some workstations with large external monitors, possibly external keyboards and mice, and otherwise ergonomically–friendly setups.  Hunching over a laptop screen and keyboard for hours shouldn't be a requirement of any collaborative space.  (Now, it's a trick to design a space where several people can be working together behind monitors and still be able to make eye contact, but that's why you have professionals to help.)

				<div class="post"><p>I had the chance to do a little of this a few years ago at Wooster with a space I both resided in and supported in their media lab. I'm sure I'll repeat some of what's already been posted, but here's my two cents:</p>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<p>Most people will bring their own laptop, collaborative work, brainstorming, casual atmosphere?</p>
<p>Connectivity:</p>
<p>Floor boxes every 4-6 feet or so in each direction with data and power,and also frequent data/power on wall. IMHO, you just can't have enough of these. Have a box of 4-6ft. data cables around because most people won't have one. Also, a box of all of those silly mac video adapters and some vga/dvi adapters. At my current school we cover these in bright pink tape to cut down on theft =)</p>
<p>Great wireless signal and bandwidth. </p>
<p>Displays:</p>
<p>You can probably find some small LCD TVs for less than the cost of large computer monitors. Whatever size you think you want, add at least 4-6" onto that (seems we always wanted something bigger, even if the size sounded right) or see if you can "try out" some sizes. Mount them on mobile stands along with a power strip and make sure it has a long cord. </p>
<p>I think one main display is nice too. Depending on the size of the room and your budget, LCD may be a better option than projection as it is not as affected by fluorescent lighting, which means if you want to use it you won't need to dim things and potentially disturb other groups/staff in the space. That said, size is cheaper with projection if the space is large and you can always zone the lighting. It might be nice to have an inexpensive machine connected to the main display while still allowing a laptop connection.  </p>
<p>Furniture:</p>
<p>Everything needs wheels! Nothing too big. Everything comfy. I would say the "student desk" type of chair is a must-not-have - gosh I hate those things. Smaller, mobile whiteboards in addition to wall-mounted ones are really nice too. Depending on the size of the space and size of the groups working together, maybe a mobile partition or two is a good idea as well. </p>
<p>Messages and Decor:</p>
<p>If you have examples of the type of work you hope the space will encourage, try to illustrate or highlight those things in the space in some way (posters, images). I'm also a big fan of "move me" and "plug me in" types of signs just to assure people that reconfiguring is encouraged. Dull, institutional paint colors are must-not-haves for sure! </p>
<p>Staff Space:</p>
<p>I always wanted a way to better "hide" myself at times when I was not the active support in our collaborative space. Unfortunately, I sat in a glass office in the corner without much privacy and this made it hard to bury myself in a project when I wasn't supporting the lab. </p>
<p>..this is really long now, so I'm going to stop. These are my favorite types of spaces, though - please share pics when you are all done and thanks for crowdsourcing it!

			<div class="threadpost">
				<div class="post"><p>Thanks, Julie! We are pretty lucky to have some fabulous spaces for digital humanities work at the <a href="http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/">Scholars' Lab</a>!  What I most like about them is that they are so varied.  </p>
<p>In the main lab, we've got a wide-open space that (at least once a week and often more) we reconfigure from a jumble of cushioned chairs and coffee-tables to more formal seating in circles or rows (with a wheel-in podium) for public lectures. There are fixed workstations with gigantic monitors out there some in single stations in the airy portion of the lab and some in pairs or trios in "collaboration cubicles" in the back.  (Each collaboration cubby also has its own whiteboard and half-height, semi-transparent walls.)  Also in the main portion of the lab are these great tables from Herman Miller's "<a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/The-Intersect-Portfolio">Intersect</a>" line, that fold down to almost nothing, so they're easy to get out the way when not needed.  (They're also nice because they have a hole in the middle for power cords.)</p>
<p>We've got two rooms that adjoin the main lab.  One is a classroom, which we've recently converted from having rows of workstations to a big conference table in the middle (actually three of the tables I mentioned above) with seven or eight workstations around the edges.  This conversion was possible because we'll be able to do more and more of our instruction on students' own laptops using UVa's "Hive" <a href="http://itc.virginia.edu/hive/">software virtualization</a> program.  It makes the room much more flexible for different kinds of teaching and meetings.  There are fixed whiteboards in there (but my next project is to paint the whole thing with whiteboard paint.)</p>
<p>Two of our full-time staff have offices in what they call "hexicles" out in the SLab public space.  They claim the low rumble of student conversation is not a bother, and their area is a bit secluded behind the big semi-circular public service desk. (That's one thing I would *not* advocate including in any space plan -- the service model for libraries is changing to a degree that it no longer makes sense (economic or otherwise -- in a digital lab, anyway) to design a space to point visitors at a big, authoritative reference desk.)</p>
<p>Finally, we've got a little, glassed-in room called the "ThinkTank."  We remodeled it ourselves on a shoestring, from a very antiseptic meeting room with a single table and a desktop computer on a massive media cart, to a very intimate (not to say funky) conversation space.  We painted the two un-windowed walls a very dark grey, brought in two leather 1920s fainting sofas from the Library's surplus shed, a couple of floor-lamps with gorgeous red shades, and created a coffee table ourselves from a surplused glass Special Collections display case. (We took a hacksaw to the legs, and filled it with motion-sensitive LEDs that sparkle and ripple with light when you set your coffee-cup down. (This did involve a conversation with Procurement on why we were placing parts orders with a company called <a href="http://evilmadscience.com/">Evil Mad Science Dot Com</a>.)  There's a small whiteboard in there and an enormous, wall-mounted flatscreen TV with laptop hookups.  I love having this room as part of the public spaces of the Scholars' Lab, because gives an entirely different vibe.  If the rest of the SLab (with its black-and-white tiled floors and mid-century Modern Eames fabrics) is <em>The Jetsons</em>, the ThinkTank's a space-age Victorian opium den.  People use it so much more often to have real conversations and planning meetings now.</p>
<p>Back in our staff office area, we have a little kitchenette (so nice to have!) with fridges, a microwave, coffeepots, and a sink -- and also a water cooler.  Our Grad Fellows in Digital Humanities have free run of this, along with our staff.  That's good, because right around the corner is a nice room with big windows that we've given over to our Fellows as their office and hang-out space.  We put small tables along the wall with power hookups for their laptops, a big, rolling whiteboard, and another flatscreen TV in there.  It also has bookshelves which they can use for their stuff and on which most of our staff store their hard-copy tech manuals.  Some cushy chairs and ottomans, too.</p>
<p>On staff offices: I'm the only one with a private office, although three of the people who work in R&amp;D (software developers attached to the SLab) have a shared office with a door that closes.  Most of our staff -- five or six others -- share a big office in which everybody has a dedicated workspace, but which is laid out so that there's a big, open, central area for conversation and collaboration.  One desk in that room is secluded in a kind of traditional cubicle, and others have some privacy because they're in corners, but the open feel, the glass door, and the big windows in that room give a sense of shared space.</p>
<p>We have a couple of white-boards-on-wheels that we make excellent, regular use of.  Everyone has either one very big external monitor or (for designers and GIS types) two.</p>
<p>Everybody seems to like <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Celle-Chairs">their chairs</a>, which are pretty ergonomic and nicely adjustable.  The brand we got come with or without pads, and everyone got to make a choice -- and everyone argues his or her choice was the right one.   Anyway, if you can splurge a little on chairs for the staff who will spend a lot of time in them, you should.</p>
<p>Cut a hole in a wall to make a window if you have to -- people need natural light.</p>
<p>That's it! I'm tapped out.  I should take some good pictures of our spaces to share, but there are some small and ill-staged ones attached to my last two "Day of Digital Humanities" posts (<a href="http://ra.tapor.ualberta.ca/~dayofdh/BethanyNowviskie/">1</a> and <a href="http://ra.tapor.ualberta.ca/~dayofdh2010/bethanynowviskie/">2</a>).</p>
<p>I know the Emory crowd saw our space -- it was great fun to host you guys! -- but thought I'd share this quick overview for others who may be thinking along similar lines.
