				<div class="post"><p>In a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/reporting-from-hastac-2011/37717#comment-387479756">recent comment at <em>ProfHacker</em></a>, Cheryl Ball writes</p>
<blockquote><p>It seems I always end up in sessions where "DH" folks present on topics as if they've just discovered them. Digital dissertations aren't a new problem. Using discussion forums in your classes is not a new pedagogy. Getting tenure for digital work is not a new form of administrative harassment. </p>
<p>Digital Humanities Questions &amp; Answers (or someone) should start a wiki-book project that summarizes the 30+ years of computers-and-composition scholarship (in one-paragraph chunks + annotated bibliographies) that has been addressing these issues. Off the top of my head: You want digital dissertations? See Moxley, Edminster, Kuhn. You want digital- and collaborative-related tenure issues? See Lang, Walker, &amp; Dorwick (2000) or Katz, Walker, &amp; Cross (1997). You want discussion forums? See Faigley, Cooper, or McKee. Just a thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm interested in hearing people's answers to this question: "What is the relationship of DH to Computers-&amp;-Composition?"<br />
But also this: "What <em>should</em> the relationship of DH to Computers-&amp;-Composition be?"

<p>The objective of this roundtable is to facilitate interactions between digital humanists and writing studies scholars who, despite shared interests in digital authorship, intellectual property, peer review, classroom communication, and textual revision, have often failed to collaborate.

				<div class="post"><p>To me, a crucial pivot point in DH relationship to Computers &amp; Composition is Web 2.0, combined with revolutions in EdTech. Computers &amp; Composition with TEI is radically different from Computers &amp; Composition with WordPress. There was a big split there, I think, which is why some strands of DH have a lot in common with EdTech and some strands have nothing in common with EdTech.</p>
<p>And so, I think that there should be different responses to that question, going down the different lines of the degree to which they address Web 2.0 -- by which I mean easy, quick web publishing with an equally easy and quick publication of responses.

				<div class="post"><p>What I think Ball is getting at is that these questions about digital dissertations, digital discussion forums, and tenure for digital work are conversations that have been central to the Computers and Writing conference since its beginning and that folks in DH interested in these topics may want to read field literature in Computers and Composition/Digital Rhetoric. This would include the online journal Kairos as well as Computers and Composition, Computers and Composition online, and work on digital rhetoric published by Parlor Press/Hampton/and the new Computers and Composition Digital Press. These conversations have largely happened within a CW field bubble and are now more readily visible thanks to Twitter and conferences such as MLA (not usually the major place for scholars in Rhetorical Studies/Computers and Composition to present but now much more common thanks to the growing digital interest), and I think Ball is referencing a general frustration I've seen on the TechRhet listserv (the main listserv in C&amp;C) regarding this recent contact moment between fields. </p>
<p>Back in June on TechRhet there was a long thread about the relationship between DH/CW and my position has been that both fields have something to gain from each other. IMO, Computers and Writing does not yet have enough examples of cross-disciplinary collaboration like one would find at the upcoming DH 12 conference. The emerging field of DH does not yet have enough scholars talking about the rhetorics/audiences/UX/UCD concerns of DH projects.</p>
<p>Related, Bill Hart-Davidson and I have a CFP that invites proposals exploring these connections: </p>

				<div class="post"><p>I think the answer to this question depends in part on the definition of DH being deployed. The sort of "small tent DH" that I think Patrick is referring to as "Computers and Composition and TEI" doesn't have much in common with the scholarship produced by Computers and Writing scholars; however, "big tent DH" and computers and writing have much in common. Early scholarship in C&amp;W argued for teaching code as a form of writing and wrote software that enabled collaboration in the writing classroom. More recent scholarship has focused on issues of digital pedagogy and digital scholarship—including the work cited by Cheryl in digital dissertations and promotion and tenure. One of the oldest multimedia journals, Kairos, was established almost 15 years ago by graduate students in C&amp;W and RhetComp and a quick look through those archives (as well as those of the print and online editions of Computers and Composition) show a broad range of digital scholarship—some of which seems to just be emerging in other more literature-focused publications. </p>
<p>And yes, there is some frustration here; just as there is frustration for me when I go to RhetComp conferences and attend presentations on topics covered 15+ years ago at  C&amp;W conferences. Many of us have been working on the fringes of a "fringe" field within English Depts for quite a while, and now, almost suddenly, we find that our area of study has become the "hot topic," yet our contributions to this scholarship are frequently not cited or ignored. </p>
<p>I think there is plenty of overlap and am part of a growing group of scholars who are seeking ways to build bridges between the fields of DH and C&amp;W. (In fact I am on panels at both CCCCs and Computers &amp; Writing this year that are addressing this very topic with scholars from C&amp;W, DH, RhetComp, and Professional Writing.) As these bridges are being built I think it is important for scholars working in these areas to look at sources from outside their specific areas of specialization to make sure that all relevant scholarship is found and, if appropriate, cited. After all, there are plenty of those higher up in administration that still need to be convinced; we might as well pool our resources and scholarship toward that goal rather than fighting over who said what first!

				<div class="post"><p><em>Replying to @Patrick Murray-John's <a href="/DH-Answers-Archive/topic/the-relationship-of-dh-to-computers-composition#post-1487">post</a>:</em></p>
<p>Hi Patrick. I've been mulling over your post for a coupla days. I'd like to respond to a few errors, if I may. Terminology seems to be a problem here -- as we may be in agreement, but I'm not recognizing the way you're talking about the issue. So apologies in advance if I've misread. My aim is to clarify.</p>
<p>First, this point: "a crucial pivot point in DH relationship to Computers &amp; Composition is Web 2.0". When I first read this last week, I went all "gaaaah!!!" because it seemed to prove my point that most folks don't seem to know that computers and composition, as a scholarly subdiscipline of rhetoric and composition predates "Web 2.0" by, oh, a good 20 years. It predates networked computing in university settings. It predates the Web. So, I guess I'm a little confused what Web 2.0 has to do with this discussion at all. (DHers would, I think, have a similar story -- predating Web 2.0 via HCI work in the 50s and 60s just as c&amp;c work goes back to non-digital rhetorical work of the mid-20th century and earlier.) Then I realized I got hung up on "pivot": you mean "diverge"? Maybe, but really c&amp;c and DH were never together as a field or an interdisciplinary grouping to begin with for many people. </p>
<p>Second, here's some in-field jargon that might help clarify things. (And, fwiw, people in our own field get this stuff wrong all the time...):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computers &amp; Composition</strong> is the name of the (premier?) print-based journal that folks in digital writing studies (nee computers-and-composition studies) read. This journal began publishing in 1983. The history of the journal can be read here: <a href="http://computersandcomposition.candcblog.org/html/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://computersandcomposition.candcblog.org/html/history.htm</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Computers &amp; Writing</strong> is the name of the annual conference that digital writing studies scholars attend. The next one is at NCSU: <a href="http://chasslamp.chass.ncsu.edu/~cw2012/cfp" rel="nofollow">http://chasslamp.chass.ncsu.edu/~cw2012/cfp</a>. Come join us!!</li>
<li><strong>computers-and-composition</strong> is the name of the sub/in-discipline of rhetoric and composition scholars whose research and teaching focus on the impact and use of (digital) technologies in writing. Lately, people have started referring to this discipline by other names, including digital rhetoric(s), digital writing studies, whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that's just a start. The other thing is, I guess, that digital writing scholars (c&amp;cers) rarely use TEI because we don't have much of a need for it. (People WILL disagree with me... and Louie Ulman is a great example of someone in literacy studies who uses a lot of TEI in his research and teaching. But, **generally speaking**, C&amp;Wers [people who attend C&amp;W and read C&amp;C, etc.] don't do a lot of mark-up with TEI, so the split as you've described it doesn't make a whole lotta sense to someone in that field. (Why do we not do a lot of mark-up with TEI? Because we're mostly studying writing-in-process or contemporary writing, not "cultural artifacts" of famous writing that someone has digitized. Again, MAJOR generalization.) </p>
<p>lol, Primer 101 on C&amp;W Jargon now over :)

<p>A much-needed primer! Thanks!</p>
<p>Indeed, I was speaking from only a glancing knowledge of Computers and Composition as in the journal, and of the history of the field it covers. Probably most precise to say that I was thinking "computers-and-composition" as you describe it, where my little bit of training in composition and rhetoric started to kick in.</p>
<p>From that standpoint, I'm right there with you about "pivot"/"divergence" trickiness. I was, indeed, aware of plenty of work in computers-and-composition before Web 2.0-y things, and "pivot" was the closest word I could come up with. "Divergence" is also good, because of the rhetorics at work -- the relationships between computers and the writing process certainly change when we replace "computers" with "web sites". And so I suspect that we're in agreement, but did indeed get hung up on my fuzzy use of terms (and, because of that, my making iffy-at-best assumptions about where TEI fits into it -- my thinking was, "TEI is an example of writing with computers -- and indeed an example of DH -- that way predates Web 2.0. Close enough!")</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether "pivot" or "diverge" is the best word. "Pivot" probably implies a single line that veers into a new direction, while "diverge" sees it as a single line that turns into two different lines. For both "Digital Humanities" and (lower-case) "computers and composition", maybe choosing one word over the other is ultimately a matter of how we view the evolution of the fields?</p>
<p>Sorry for the "GAAAHHH!!" moment! I definitely acknowledge that background, even if I'm not as familiar with it as I should be! :)
