				<div class="post"><p>At THATCamp New England, right now, we're talking about the practice some institutions have of digitizing public domain images and then putting all kinds of license restrictions on them.  This is probably not ideal: they're free to <em>sell</em> those images, but putting restrictions on them seems sketchy.  On the other hand, they did digitize them and make them available.  For an example, see Matthew Battles' article <a href="http://hilobrow.com/2010/10/07/space-for-sale/">"Space For Sale."</a></p>
<p>An idea is being floated: what if image providers (cultural institutions and commercial providers) were required to put up a notice, something like: "The content of this image is in the public domain.  You may be able to find a free copy of it elsewhere."?</p>
<p>If we were to assume that restricting the use of public domain images is not best practice, what are institutional examples of best practice?  What institutions fall short of best practice?</p>
<p>It seems to us that the Getty example in Battles' article falls under the latter category.  Google Books (see <a href="http://books.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=44666">here</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=43738">here</a>) seems to follow best practice.</p>
<p>To be clear: most of these thoughts are not mine but the collective's.  :)

				<div class="post"><p>Vika,</p>
<p>It is, as you know, a thorny subject.  The question is whether digitizing the image adds any IPR on the digital image itself.  Currently most rulings find that digital photography of an existing image does imbue the digital photograph with IPR belonging to the photographer.  If I take a photo of a painting which is in the public domain I could, for example, do interesting things with light, exposure, or the method of photography which creates an artistic expression all of its very own.  To deny that this then had copyright would be to diminish my creative input.  However, there have been some rulings in cases where the copying is photocopying or copying of a sort which does not provide any creative input which have said that no new IPR is vested in the digital image.</p>
<p>For what its worth, I tend to think that digital photography is so wide and varied in quality that any good image must have IPR associated with it.  Whether it is morally right or wrong to take a good photograph of a public domain work and then apply licenses to it is also debatable.  If people feel strongly about it, they can go and take other photographs of that public domain work and license them (or not) however they so wish. (Ok, not so true with the NASA images).  </p>
<p>A related topic is whether people can enforce contract conditions upon your own IPR when you take a photograph.  For example, the British Museum (which I fund through my taxes) allows you to take photos as long as you don't use a tripod and they are for 'personal and private use'.  My personal and not-so private use for these photos is to put them on my website and license them with a CC+by+sa license <a href="http://gallery.blushingbunny.net/v/james/Other/BritishMuseum/">http://gallery.blushingbunny.net/v/james/Other/BritishMuseum/</a> (though I really should re-do them, I've a better camera now).  I've intentionally mis-interpreted 'private' as 'non-commercial', because this is a conversation I wouldn't mind having with them at a high level. (Esp. given that my images are so crappy that they surely do not impinge on any revenue stream the BM has.)  But the question is: can the British Museum impose restrictions on what I do with images which only have my IPR attached to them?  (I.e. the medieval art certainly has no copyright attached).</p>
<p>But returning to your original point, it is not only a problem with images, but texts as well, Google Books added restrictions to make public domain US Government publications (though I think it has now reverted those), simply because it was easier to do than sort just them out as different.</p>
<p>Not sure that is an answer, just an agreement that this is indeed a problem.</p>
<p>-James

				<div class="post"><p>Dorothea, I'm pretty sure that James is referring to British law, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp.#Relevance_to_U.K._law">seems to be diverging from Bridgeman v. Corel</a>. </p>
<p>I've had a couple of experiences recently scrutinizing US-based digitized public-domain documents from different organizations.  While I can't really say what might constitute best-practices, I certainly have opinions one what I liked and disliked about each of them:</p>
<p>Footnote.com includes this statement in its <a href="http://www.footnote.com/termsandconditions/">Terms of Use</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Footnote.com does not claim a copyright to images already in the public domain that it has then converted into a digital format. However, through agreements we have obtained, and may continue to obtain, certain images or documents that are protected by copyrights or that, even if in the public domain, are subject to restrictions on reuse. Unless such specific restrictions apply, we encourage Members to reproduce public domain images from the Website for their own personal use. By agreeing to these Terms of Service, however, you agree to limit your reuse and republication of such public domain images to small portions of the Footnote collection. For purposes of this paragraph, a "small portion" means a limit of no more than 200 images per year. If you republish public domain images, you agree to credit Footnote.com as the source of the digital image, unless additional specific restrictions apply. If you wish to republish more than a small portion of the Footnote.com collection, you agree to obtain prior written permission from us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I might wish that the terms for republication were more generous, there are some very specific things that they're doing right:</p>
<ol>
<li>No <a href="http://ragesoss.com/blog/2009/01/30/libraries-and-copyfraud/">copyfraud</a> -- they explicitly deny possessing copyright over PD documents.</li>
<li>The attribution clause is clear-cut.</li>
<li>There's a bail-out clause in the "prior written permission" section.</li>
<li>Best of all, they provide a <em>specific number-per-year</em> to let the user know whether their republication will comply with the agreement or not.  As a result, I was able to figure out whether <a href="http://beta.fromthepage.com/display/read_work?ol=c_work_list_work&amp;work_id=12">republishing a Civil War-era letter</a> was allowed, with no ambiguity.</li>
</ol>
<p>My other recent experience was in paying the University of Virginia library to scan a 19th-century manuscript in their special collections.  Since I was planning to put the diary images online for transcription and since I was paying $300 out of my own pocket for the scanning work, I really wanted to make sure that I wouldn't be bound by any agreements not to re-publish the images.  </p>
<p>This was a more frustrating experience, I'm afraid.  The library posts a number of its policies online, but they're hard to reconcile with each other.  The <a href="http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/digitalcuration/use_of_materials.html">Digitization Services "Use of Materials" policy</a> states: "Reproductions of materials obtained from Digitization Services (or from its web site) may be made without prior permission only for use in the research, teaching, or private study of the recipient of the reproduction. Reproductions ... may not be further reproduced without permission.  The recipient agrees ... to secure permission in advance from Digitization Services to publish or broadcast any item, in whole or in part, from its collections."  Is putting the scans online for transcription private study or publishing?  The statement also directs users to the <a href="http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/small/using/use_of_materials_policy.html">Special Collections "Use of Materials Policy"</a> which says "It is not necessary to seek the Library’s permission as the owner of the physical work to publish or otherwise distribute portions of texts or individual images (up to 20 from any given work or collection) for educational or scholarly purposes."  Other use policies mention a fee of $100 per image for commercial use</p>
<p>All of that seemed a bit high-handed, given that 1) the manuscript was in the public domain as an unpublished work whose author died in 1882, 2) I'm paying to have the thing scanned, and 3) I'm doing so in collaboration with members of the author's family who are already irate about the document being "locked away in a library" in the first place.  However, the <a href="https://tracksys.lib.virginia.edu/request">Digitization Services request form</a> included a bail-out clause: "I understand and agree to the above copyright statement and will only use the digitized resources as I indicate in my online request."  I was able to describe exactly how I intended to use the images, and happily the further steps in the web form even allowed me to select "publishing on the web" as an option for use.  As a result, I was able to continue with the project feeling that the library had agreed to my planned use (rather than me having to agree to its restrictions), and have been delighted by the scans.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of experiences from the perspective of an amateur local history researcher.

<p>Ben, (putting on my work hat) I just want to thank you for laying out the ambiguities and contradictions you found in our policies. I'm sharing your post with folks at UVa connected to our Digitization Services, Special Collections, and Collections Steering groups.  I know that work is already well underway to create more helpful, clear, and (I think) liberating access and use guidelines for digital content, but I'm sure your experience can still help inform those conversations.</p>
<p>And Dorothea, wow -- thanks for that citation!

<p>Thanks, Bethany!  One really important thing I should mention is that despite my frustration determining policy, I <em>was</em> able to do what I wanted with the material, and that that use (high-quality scans of 800+ pages) was something I never would have been legally able to do with a Footnote.com or such.  I consider the money well spent, and appreciate the flexibility during my dialog with the digitization service.  UVa's service was a welcome contrast with the Clements Library at University of Michigan, whose <a href="http://www.clements.umich.edu/Hours.html">policies and fees</a> were so forbidding that I didn't even bother inquiring.
